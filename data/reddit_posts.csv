I want to want things. I want to be a normal human being with normal goals and motivations, i want to want to believe in god, i want to want a family, I want to want to have sex I want normal things. I'm stuck in a void of nothingness, porn is not enjoyable, gaming hasn't been enjoyable since 2019 , the only thing that slightly excites me is food and gluttony, I eat vast amounts of foods just to feel something, i try to listen to music I used to love and i don't feel anything. Everyday I can't wait for the hour I take my pills and sleep. My body has become extremely disgusting and I don't even care, I don't want to impress anyone why would I care? I used to feel guilty about it but now I don't have an ounce of negative feelings. 

I don't feel lonely anymore, how is that normal? I'm actually scaring myself, I feel like a psychopath in isolation, I'm actually afraid of going outside, ive heard the criminal documentaries I don't wanna give my brain any chances. I also have chronic pain and struggle to move or do any activities, just bathing is difficult and ruins the rest of my day unless I dump some painkillers on my mouth.

I'm so sick of life and will be single forever.,"I'm so tired of everything. It sucks, but it's true. I have a horrible face card, I have a style many would call unapproachable and I'm bisexual, meaning most girls would think of me as gay and there aren't any gay guys near where I live. I used to have one, but he broke up with out giving a real reason and we didn't even get to hug (we were long distance). Everywhere I go, someone has a partner. My friends are getting partners, my dad got a girlfriend and my cousins do too. But I won't. 

I hate that I don't have anyone to just chat with, my friends don't really know how to respond. I'm still just a teenager, but I have no hope. I breakdown once a month, sometimes at school and I have to go to the bathroom as an excuse. It's harder everyday for me to carry on so I don't think I will. Only thing stopping me is that it will screw up my already fucked up family.

Haven‚Äôt I suffered enough?,"I‚Äôm 27. I live with my chronically ill mom and my narcissistic divorced father who shaped me into the patehtic excuse of a man I am today. No girls ever experienced interest in me growing up; friends moved on from me easily even after I tried to be an enjoyable person to be around; social anxiety and overthinking and holding in feelings became a safe haven for me.

The best years of my life was when I was in college, taking long walks, blasting music on my cheap headphones, losing so much weight (though no one cared to compliment or even comment on it), but even then I remember being miserable. I would wake up stressed and crying due to how difficult my classes were, depressed after getting a bad grade, clinging onto love over a woman who used me for her satisfaction.

I really am just fed up of mental illness,"Im 41, 42 november. also have a learning disability. I have never had a relationship ever.

part of my issue is that i really am only attracted to muscular women. Idk why, I just am. And Ive tried so hard to look past it and tried to date people not muscular, but I just always kind of resented it and felt like i never wanted to be physical with them so it never went anywhere. I wish i could help it. Ive tried everywhere. Ive looked everywhere. In gyms, online, dating sites, etc. no luck.

its worse because im fat. And its a cycle. I decide to try to get in shape, make some progress, then depression hits and i get fatter when i eat using comfort food. I dont have a career , i make no money because my depressions so bad i cant work. And my country is told to see us with mental health issues as ‚Äújust making it up‚Äù or can just work through it when the truth is i cant even cope with every day things.

how could i ever expect an athletic woman to want me? And whenever i try to improve my life it goes wrong because my depressions always there. Its always waiting . And its exhausting. Im so tired of life. Im here for my older brother and sister but when they pass as they are both decades older i dont see myself staying.

im so alone and nothing i can do can help me. I wish i could just find a muscular woman who liked me snd didnt care i wasnt rich and maybe we could work out together . Maybe that would help because even tho people say love yourself i promise you when youve missed out in major milestones in human relationships and just face rejection its hard to feel satisfied. I love my own company, i do, but i just csnt find any woman i want to be with who does.

i know people say get over the muscular thing but the truth si even when i tried i had no desire to be physical with the women i tried to date and i dont think it would be fair to have a relationship which is just friendship when they might want to be physical and i just wouldnt want them that way.

i feel so alone and lost. I feel my life isnt worth living. If my brother and sister were gone id take euthenasia tomorrow.

sorry i just needed to rant. I feel like i cant cope with life. And i know im going to die alone and no woman ever chose me as her favourite person. And all i ever wanted was that in life.

Obviously therapy isnt working because Honestly Im so over people acting like therapy is the ultimate fix for everything Like wow let me pay someone to nod and ask ‚ÄúAnd how does that make you feel?‚Äù for an hour while my life falls apart. Talking about my problems doesnt magically erase them. Half the time I leave more frustrated than when I walked in. Not every issue can be solved by venting to a stranger with a degree.

I am a SAHM and adore my children. I spend the majority of my time at home. Every single time I am in a social situation with others my age (mostly my husband‚Äôs friends/wives), I enjoy myself but the following day am wrecked. I rethink every single thing I said and feel stupid.

Just want to disappear abroad and start over,"I'm 35M. Divorced, no kids, left my religious community same time as my divorce and am now shunned, so no friends or family. The only time my family reaches out is to tell me to come back to the religion (JW).

I work from home, call center, and just hate my job. I hate being yelled at all day, pressured to follow strict metrics, getting negative reviews that are about the company and not me, but it brings my scores down.

I just want to disappear. I want to just travel Europe, go to Thailand, or Japan. And just leave everything behind. Leave my job. Leave my apartment. Get rid of all my stuff. And just escape.

I know it won't 'fix me'. I know it won't solve my problems. I'll be alone and tired and anxious and depressed with no self esteem anywhere I go. But I just can't take my life anymore. If I've already lost everything what's the point of trying to live a 'normal' life, work a 9-5, buy a house, get a mortgage, etc. I tried dating, I had a beautiful, sweet, kind, warm, loving girlfriend. Someone who really cared about me. We were together for about a year. But my anxiety and depression won out. I let her go. I couldn't handle it, having someone rely on me, imagining a future together. I just couldn't. So I ended her relationship. Broke her heart. I just disappoint and hurt everyone I know. 

I think about just ending my life every day. But part of me still wants to explore and see the world. It's the only bit of hope I have.

So i want to just disappear. Let everything go. I'm finally close to paying off the remainder of my debt and that's it. Maybe I'm just nervous and depressed about going back to work this week. So I'll just sit here and play video games to forget about my life.

It's like no matter what I do, think, say or feel it's just stupid and retarded. Everywhere I go I give people a reason to hate me without even trying. I can just make a little or big noise and people look at me as if I'm crazy or they want to hurt me. Literally everything is making me so mad I cannot hide it if I want to. I'm so tired of this stupid garbage life I live now. I want to live but it's like I have a curse which makes everything unimaginably difficult for me and others and I cant blame anyone. I get no joy or satisfaction or relief from anything anymore. It's like every little thing that I can see, touch, smell, feel, and taste is only a tool to further enhance my misery. To say I'm miserable and want to die is a incredible understatement. ",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lnieb9/i_actually_hate_my_life/,1751213339.0,depression
A Story I‚Äôve Held Inside for Too Long.,"(Trigger Warning: Emotional Abuse / Internalized Homophobia / Depression / 
Dark Thoughts)

This is a lot to read, so fair warning. I‚Äôm not writing this for attention or sympathy. I just need to share my story, because I‚Äôve been holding it inside for too long, and it‚Äôs been quietly destroying me.

My entire life, I‚Äôve questioned my sexuality. I grew up being taught that liking boys was wrong, a sin that would be punished. My friends would make jokes about it constantly, and I‚Äôd sit there silently, laughing along to fit in, even though every word cut me deeply. Nobody knew I was gay. I buried that part of myself so deeply that even I began to forget who I was.

I dated girls. I forced myself to be someone I wasn‚Äôt, hoping that pretending hard enough would make it true. It never worked. The internal pressure eventually became too much. I dropped out of school from stress and anxiety that, deep down, I know came from repressing who I truly am. That spiraled into depression, and before I realized it, years passed by in a blur of numbness and pain. I missed so much.

Eventually, I met a group of friends, and for the first time in forever, I felt a little happiness. We grew close, did everything together. And within this group, there was a boy. I‚Äôll call him Ky.

Ky and I got really close. We‚Äôd joke, argue playfully, and spend time together outside the group. Movies, food, exchanging gifts, talking all the time. One night, I drove him home and we held hands for a bit. It was small, but it meant the world to me. For the first time since I was a kid, I felt hope. I felt alive. Loved, even. We‚Äôd even joke about relationships and kissing sometimes, it made me believe, maybe, just maybe, he felt something too.

This went on for a couple of months. I was building up the courage to tell him how I felt. He would‚Äôve been the first boy I ever opened up to like that.

But then‚Ä¶ everything changed.

One night, we were all in a party chat playing Xbox, and some of the guys started making homophobic jokes, stuff I won‚Äôt even repeat. I stayed silent. I was used to it. But then one of the friends made a joke aimed at me and Ky, something like:
‚ÄúYou two spend so much time together, you dating behind our backs or something? Gay boys.‚Äù

Everyone laughed.

Except me.

Then Ky said something I‚Äôll never forget for the rest of my life.

‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather see him suicidal than ever be gay with him.‚Äù

And just like that‚Ä¶ every tiny bit of happiness, hope, and healing I‚Äôd built crumbled in a second. I left the party. I cried for hours. And after that night, nothing was the same.

He never apologized. He never brought it up. To this day, over a year later, i‚Äôm 24 now and we‚Äôre all still in that same friend group, and he still shows up in Xbox parties like nothing ever happened. Like we never happened. Like that moment never meant a thing.

And maybe it didn‚Äôt. Maybe I never meant anything to him. I don‚Äôt know why I keep talking to him. I don‚Äôt know why I still hope for something that was never real. But I do.

I‚Äôve stopped going outside. I‚Äôve lost motivation to do anything. My friends sometimes ask why I‚Äôm always so down, but I just say I‚Äôm going through something, and then they move on. I‚Äôm the quiet one now. The broken one.

I miss him.
And I hate that I miss him.

I don‚Äôt understand how someone I loved,  someone who felt like my first real connection, could say something so cruel and then live like it never happened. Like I don‚Äôt matter. I guess I don‚Äôt.

There were days I wanted to end everything. I slept through weeks. I barely ate. I didn‚Äôt leave my room. I became a shell of the person I once was, the person I could‚Äôve been if the world had just let me be myself.

I‚Äôm trying now. I‚Äôve made a call to a therapist. I‚Äôve been going out a little more. I‚Äôm trying to heal. But the truth is, I don‚Äôt even know if you can heal from something like this. When someone shatters a part of you that was already fragile, the part you‚Äôve been protecting your whole life, it doesn‚Äôt just bounce back. It stays cracked. It stays sore.

I‚Äôm not looking for attention. I just needed to let this out.
I don‚Äôt want to keep holding it in anymore. It‚Äôs eating me alive.

All I can hope for now is that someday‚Ä¶ somehow‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll feel whole again.
That I‚Äôll find peace.
That someone will love me for me, all of me.
And that maybe, someone reading this will feel a little less alone knowing they‚Äôre not the only one who‚Äôs been through it.

Thank you for reading.

"I think I'm depressed or falling into it, it's not typical in my culture so I don't know if I'm just being weak","I come from a culture where we're used to just getting on with things and we see depression and things like that as just soft. Recently I moved to a new city because I was really really on the verge of destruction in my old one; having fist fights with siblings, losing my mind quite often and just spending years in a single room feeling life was over and I don't know why I'm here. 

I wanted to break out of that cycle of just breaking down almost every day and coping with weed and alcohol that I moved to a new city. Now being in this new city for a few months, I feel low in spirit. I have 1 friend here who I used to date, but I decided to keep us as friends because I didn't want to have a breakup go bad and lose her. Besides her I'm alone here, it's a lovely city with kind people but I can't seem to get a break with dating, making new friends and I've fallen back into the smoking and drinking and misery. 

I didn't think anything was wrong with me until I lost my mind at my former boss cancelling my week-long shift at a music festival, this coupled with the fact my new job reduced my schedule to 3 days a week just made the reality that I'm in a lot of debt and needed that money very clear. This week has been particularly hard for me, seeing all my friends I'd planned to spend time with at the festival happy while I'm sat home just beating myself up. Like now every day I wake up so down, I try to keep up gym and stretches and walks to keep me up and it helps but I just feel there's no point to things anymore. A week ago a close family friend got sick and had surgery, another friend is depressed and another tried to take his life so I don't even feel I can speak to any of them as they're in their own situations,  this and a few other little bad moments just make me want to quit life now and get it over with. I did spend the weekend with my nephews and my mum so it lifted me and I'm grateful. Problem is I'm usually the strong friend with jokes and positive outlook so I struggle to open up to others but man I feel like I've lost all my friends from growing up and now just feel isolated here but I can't move back home I'm too old for that

I think I've just managed to ruin the only good thing I've ever let myself have,"I think I've just ruined probably my only relationship I'll ever have. I'm in uni preparing for an exam tomorrow and went to pick up a food delivery for me and my girlfriend when I got back in she was looking through the youtube history and found some videos talking about discovering if your trans and how to live with it. ( I'm not trans but I did think I may have been up until about a week ago ) we already talked about this issue I had and agreed that we both don't think I am trans to which she was thankful because she doesn't think that she will still be attracted to me and wish to stay if I was, which I respect. We both cried for about an hour before being able to move on but finding the old videos in the history makes her think that I lied and that I'm hiding somthing from her and that she doesn't trust me to not hide anything from her anymore.

I tried to explain but she didn't believe me at all and I can't stand the thought of losing her, she's the only good thing I have and is the only reason I haven't ended everything already and am still on my course but I'm afraid I'm going to lose that reason soon as she walked away and won't speak to me.

Don't know what to do anymore I doubt she'll believe me if I try explain to her again and I don't see anything positive in any outcome anymore",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lnpuca/i_think_ive_just_managed_to_ruin_the_only_good/,1751231765.0,depression

It‚Äôs a house that‚Äôs dead inside, held together with fake smiles, past memories, and little and short moments of happiness that fades fast.The reason for the depression is different but heavy. When people come over the house is bright and warm, when they leave the air becomes still and cold filled with distant memories and heavy with people doing mundane tasks.

I wish someone understood,"I feel like I will sound like a broken record writing this but I would really appreciate some uplifting words or encouragement. I have alot to be grateful for in my life right now, I have my health, a roof over my head, a job, and someone I love. But I‚Äôve struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a child. My depression has really subsided since I moved away from home to go to college. I never felt so normal. Not even like joy but just normalcy and not feeling like I need to survive everyday. If there‚Äôs anything you should understand from reading this, it‚Äôs that my family hasn‚Äôt been the best to me emotionally. My parents get mad at me when I admit that I am feeling down. I remember growing up and being yelled at for crying. So now I don‚Äôt really cry a lot it‚Äôs hard to for some reason but sometimes I wish I could just cry when im overwhelmed. Ever since I‚Äôve been back home for the summer away from college I feel like im getting bad again. Being with my family is like being in the loudest silence ever and it feels like one wrong move and everything will explode. I‚Äôve been working so much since summer started and my job is the one thing that both is overwhelming me but also keeping me afloat. I work so I can afford school because I want to go to graduate school and I want to study abroad if I save enough money. I‚Äôve been taking on triple doubles every week. It‚Äôs been so overwhelming but I actually rather be at work than home. Today, I was really sad and just felt alone. I left my house and showered for the first time in a couple days. I was wanting to do something by myself and for myself on my one day off. But everything just went wrong. It was storming outside, the store I wanted to go to was closed, my car ran out of gas. I know all of this is small things but it was enough for me to cry on the drive home alone because I just wanted a day for myself. I gave up and showered and crawled into bed. I just want to be alone but I also just want someone to understand. I told my mom I was sad because I want comfort so bad. It‚Äôs weird wanting comfort from someone you also fear. I just want my mom for a few minutes. She seemed upset that I was sad. I said I don‚Äôt know why I was feeling like this today. She hasn‚Äôt talked to me for the rest of the day.

Being poor makes me depressed.,"I hate being poor. I currently live off of my SSDI checks, since I can't work due to my autism, my digestive disorders, and my chronic back pain.

I can't even afford to move to another state, since I need my Section 8 voucher, and I'm pretty sure you have to live without it for some time before you can get it transferred to the state you've moved to. I just feel so unhappy in so many ways due to my poverty, and the fact that millions of people here in the US don't even care about my well-being as a poor person (thus the whole ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" nonsense) just makes me feel even worse.

i just want to be happy for fucks sake,"i‚Äôm (17F) messed up in the head because of all the shit that i been through. because of depression and trauma, i can barely even remember shit. i graduated high school in May and am about to enter uni, but everything that i been through and witnessed fucked me up mentally.

idk what i did to deserve any of the shit that i went through. i‚Äôm tired of always dealing w immature ass people. 

i still am upset over a guy that i liked in my freshman year, who ended up treating me so awfully. i wish i can give 14 yr old me a hug and i feel like i betrayed her by gaining so much weight and i‚Äôm at literal obesity. 

then senior year, i end up being bullied by my former best friends (they both bullied me respectively after i ended the friendship w both, and then ended up ganging up w each other just to continue that behavior). i still am fucked up in the head because of it and it has even worsened my depression.

i feel worthless‚Ä¶,"so basically one of my friends, let's call her M, is upset with me. 

a little background... it was almost the day of prom and i hear the worst news: my other friend, let's call her Emily, announced that she's going to prom with THE GUY I LIKE. when i heard this, i felt all kinds of things:
anger. sadness. betrayal. hurt. everything attacking me at once.

now, i mean to be fair, she didn't know i liked him when she announced that, but one of my friends, let's call her Annie, told me she tried telling her that but didn't know if i still liked him since I was with this other guy for 2 days and my friends thought i was over him. 

when i tried telling Emily and my friend group, how i felt about the situation. it felt as if everyone was siding with Emily and asking me ""are you saying she CANT go with him?""

like i mean its girl code butttt anyways...

so after this all went down, a bunch of people associated me with the drama and wanted space from me.

it hurts because Emily seems so sweet, inclusive, fun, outgoing, and perfect. i guess part of me envies her. 

but anyways after some time most of my friends got over it and i did too and i thought things were back to normal....

until my friend M. 

okay so i have this feeling one day that M is avoiding me and is acting weird so i text her and ask ""hey is everything okay? i noticed you've been not acting like yourself""

and she had the audacity to say ""i need a break"" 

and i say audacity because i avoided the group for a bit after the drama because they crossed my boundaries. but M didn't respect that because she got mad at me instead. 

she said she was hurt because i was avoiding them and i said mean things about them. i apologized multiple times and we even CALLED and what did she say? well she said ""im SO grateful you called me! i understand you a lot better!""

and continues to ask for space.

i want to leave my friend group but i go to a small school and i would end up alone if i left.

also i feel like shit. i messed up everything and it's my fault. i'm severely depressed and have hit rock bottom, and that only makes people want to leave me. i want to die. i'm weak. i hate myself. but i feel so alone.

I am 38 and feel very alone and depressed.,"Coming to terms with my neurodivergence has been an extremely painful process. When no one tells you how differently you perceive the world from others the learning process is particularly harsh and damaging. When I was younger, I ran in many directions like everybody else. Towards friendships, towards love, towards a career. Each time while I was running full speed an invisible wall appeared before me and I crashed full speed into it. The body and soul are broken each time; it takes time to recover. The spirit in which I ran in any of those directions kept dying little by little. Pretty soon you are not running you are walking. Willing to settle for far less than you wanted before. It is not so much when you are running and hit the invisible wall that destroys the soul. When you are running you rationalize the crashes. I went too fast, I was too young, I didn't know. It is when you hit the same walls while seeking so much less that it really hurts. The learning curve is slow, but eventually you realize how very different you are and that the way you think about the world and process it is simply different from others. Before I turned thirty-seven I felt completely boxed in even though I was willing to crawl.

I've been feeling so anxious, and fearful of being alone in this world as an introvert. I have no one to love or get in a relationship, I don't feel attractive or interesting to anyone, I'm just that outcast you see at school that everyone ignores. 

I'm just stupid, I don't have that knowledge everyone has in common as a 17 year old. I'm just gonna spiral into severe depression and eventually end my life because I don't want to suffer the consequences of not preparing for adult responsibilities. I want to improve, but my laziness has been pulling me back. My mental health is declining and I can't save myself. 

I've never felt this depressed to the point where I am crying because of how useless I am. That I'm never gonna find love or any friends, I'm just pathetic at life. 

I'm an uneventful guy with a declining mental health that I can't seem to save myself. It's becoming pointless. 

I won't end it, I know loved ones will grieve for me, even if it's a small number, it'll hurt them more than it'll hurt me. 

There's one thing that I don't understand, why do I like the feeling of it?

I am broken,"I don‚Äôt enjoy life anymore. There‚Äôs no reason for me to try continuing to fix myself when I‚Äôm so far gone that it‚Äôs just a Sisyphus battle. 

I‚Äôve realized I‚Äôm incredibly difficult to love. Besides the fact that I‚Äôve never had a girlfriend, the girls I end up going on dates with or talking to always ends badly for me. I was texting back and forth with someone who I found very cool. I let my hopes get up and I got excited. But she then ghosted me, no explanation why. Stuff like this consistently happen. I‚Äôm the only common denominator 

Another thing is I don‚Äôt really have a plan because I messed up my life so badly. I‚Äôm in college right now. I‚Äôm a premed. My gpa is 2.6. I‚Äôm not good enough for medical school. The work experience I have within the medical field is all gotten because of family connections, not because of my own merit. I‚Äôm just too dumb. 

On top of that, my own family doesn‚Äôt believe in me. No one believes I can become a doctor. I wanted to become a psychiatrist because I believed in helping others with their problems, but I can‚Äôt even help myself. My parents are pushing a us career institute medical assistant course. Originally, I thought they still had some hope I could get into medicine. 

They accidentally let it slip that it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever get into medical school, or even PA school. They don‚Äôt believe in me. And I don‚Äôt blame them. But the course is entirely there just because they want me to have some career after college. 

I don‚Äôt believe in myself either. I mean, how could I? I didn‚Äôt have abusive parents. They‚Äôre still together. My younger brother is doing more than well with his life. And he wasn‚Äôt raised differently from me. It‚Äôs my fault that I put myself into this situation. I had the ability to pursue being a doctor, working in mental health. I had the privilege of a great upbringing. I wasn‚Äôt in any position to ever do any ‚Äúbad‚Äù things. And my parents do love me deeply. 

And yet, despite that, I still ended up broken. While many people would kill for my life, I wasn‚Äôt good enough to actually make use of it. I have no excuses. I just am like this. It doesn‚Äôt matter how much I study. How many people I talk to. How much effort I put into myself. It‚Äôs been for naught. 

I‚Äôve been broken since high school. Despite hours of therapy, medications, doing things out of my comfort zone, and just trying like a motherfucker, I‚Äôm still at 0. I‚Äôll always be a 0. 

At this point, I don‚Äôt see a foreseeable future where I‚Äôm content with my life. 

I‚Äôve tried to love myself. I‚Äôd force myself to just do the things I want to do. Need to do. From basic hygiene to the gym to socializing to studying.

Gaining weight on meds?,"I'm not sure if my meds are making me gain weight/increasing my appetite. I usually blame myself with no excuse. I know that my weight gain is related to what I've been eating. I've also been dieting and exercising (not for long, 3 weeks only) but the scale didn't budge AT ALL. If I diet and exercise heavily (1,100 kcal a day + exercise) then the scale doesn't budge. If I eat normally (1,500 kcal a day) I gain weight. If I let go for a few days I gain double the weight??? I would say I'm currently gaining weight at a rate of 2 kilos a week. It's very concerning. 

There used to be a time in my life where I didn't eat anything for days. That's when I was extremely depressed and off meds. Now all I think about is food. I can't stop eating. 

I usually take prozac and topamax. The psychiatrist specifically prescribed them to prevent weight gain and increased appetite. That's why I feel very stupid to say that I feel like my appetite is increased when I'm on them. However I've also been introduced to antipsychotics and anxiety meds 3 months ago. Ever since then I've gained 15 kilos üôÉ. 

As I said. I do blame myslef and take full responsibility for my weight gain. On the other hand I would like to consider the possibility that maybe the meds are causing weight gain because 2 kilos a week is just...??? Very scary and concerning.

"Suicidal but only ""mild"" depression","A few months ago, I had a phase that lasted only a couple of days ‚Äì maybe three or four ‚Äì where I had really intense suicidal thoughts. It felt like they were constantly in my head. I thought about it all the time and even started researching methods. Back then, I felt like lying in front of a train would be the most certain option, but when I saw that a third of people survive that with severe injuries, it scared me. I didn‚Äôt want to survive it and live with the consequences ‚Äì I just wanted it to stop.

What‚Äôs strange is that now I don‚Äôt have these kinds of thoughts anymore ‚Äì not actively. I sometimes think about it, but I know I wouldn‚Äôt actually do anything. And weirdly, that almost feels harder. Back then, the thought of ""if it doesn‚Äôt get better, I‚Äôll end it"" gave me a kind of relief, like a way out. Now I just feel stuck. Things aren‚Äôt better, but I also know I won‚Äôt act on those thoughts, so it feels like I have no option but to keep going. And that‚Äôs incredibly hard.

At the same time, my therapist diagnosed me with only a mild depression, which makes me question everything. Like ‚Äì could I even have had such thoughts if it was ‚Äúonly‚Äù a mild depression? Did I maybe exaggerate it in my memory? I don‚Äôt know.

Has anyone else experienced something like this ‚Äì a short but really intense suicidal phase, even though your diagnosis (if you have one) wasn‚Äôt that ‚Äúsevere‚Äù? I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing if others have felt this too.

I hate myself.,"Title. I hate myself so much, it baffles me that it's even possible. No matter what I do or how much I get done, I will always hate myself. It's only made all the worse with the amount of disappointment I hold against myself as I watch others succeed, and at younger ages to boot. I'm proud of those able to accomplish so much and look up to them, but I hate myself all the more when comparing myself to them. I've wanted to die for over a decade now and that feeling has not changed. The only positive is that I know no one hates me as much as I do myself. I hate myself more than anyone else possible could.

Anyone who says it gets better is giving false hope. Some aspects of life can get better, but the overall experience of living will not be positive in the long run. I was depressed when I was young, and told myself I'd have worth once I did well and passed all my classes. I did that, but was still depressed, so I told myself I'd have worth if I graduated and got accepted to a good course. I did, and nothing changed. So I continued, I'd be worthy if I got a job, if I was self sufficient. Still, nothing.

I hate it. I hate myself so much, I hate having to live with such terrible feelings. I feel like scum for even complaining. I have a much better life than many out there. I have friends, a family, a job, and I just can't seem to be happy. The incarnation of greed, I never have enough. I never am enough. I always want more.

Life seems so futile. At the end of the day, nothing will change. I will have a net zero impact on this world, so why care? Why should anything matter? I wonder if anyone is legitimately happy.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1lnayn3/i_hate_myself/,1751190895.0,depression

I feel like I can‚Äôt carry on anymore. I‚Äôve been fighting this disease for as long as I can remember, I‚Äôve been put on countless medications all of which have had more side effects than actual uses. 

Every day is the same, I wake up. Take my meds, go to work, come home, watch tv until like 4 am, take my meds again and go to bed‚Ä¶ is there anything more to this? Like seriously, if this is life what‚Äôs the point? 

Every day I feel like I‚Äôm just edging closer to the day I finally do it and at this point there‚Äôs no point in fighting anymore. 

I work with kids and I know that my sudden disappearance would have a negative effect on them and honestly at this point that‚Äôs the only thing keeping me here. Nobody else would even notice, but they would. 

I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy, I‚Äôm not looking for a fix or someone to tell me that everything will be okay because everything isn‚Äôt okay, it never really has been and probably never will be.

This is a cry for help (tw mention: sa),"Hey, My name is May I'm F17. 

I have been clinically diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD, I have been feeling so depressed and I want to end my life the week after my situationships birthday which is around July.

I have been SA'ed my entire childhood and teen years currently basically my whole life as I would say it.

I was SA'ed for 3 years (8 - 10 years old)by an relative and It left me with PTSD and I became depressed and hypersexual at an young age.
I promised myself this would never happen to me again but it happened again with an ex of mine who's SA'ed me for 3 years of our relationship, He emotionally, physically, narcissistically and sexually abused me in many ways which damaged and doubled my SA trauma and while he was SAing during these times I was SA'ed by an unknown man in an parking lot.

While I was being SA'ed by the relative, I was online chronically on Amino and I had an online boyfriend who was an year older than me and he would sex roleplay with me all the time and It made me more hypersexual so I thought that giving my body to someone was normal as a child thinking it was a way of love and attention but I knew it felt gross and werid.

I feel very depressed and I wanna die I can't stop crying all I could feel is them touching me and hurting me and I just can't get rid of the bad memories.

I have a loving family, loving friends and I met someone whos such an darling and treats me like an actual princess but I can't handle any of this pain anymore because I don't think I'm strong enough anymore, I can't escape from something that isn't there to hurt me anymore because Its in my mind everyday dissociating me.

I'm going to be a Senior but I don't think I'll ever make it to graduation, I just don't wanna suffer from all this pain and trauma anymore I'm not strong anymore I can't keep carrying it around me and act like nothing happened the most traumatizing thing thats ever happened just there happened in the past.

I have always felt like my body was more loved more than my heart was ever loved.

I don't wanna be in this body anymore, I want to get rid of this filthy touched body.

"Just a friendly reminder to everyone out there, go get a blood test!","Almost a year and a half since my first panic attack and it has definitely been a journey, have had my ups and downs, but a lot more downs than I‚Äôd like

Being the hypochondriac that I am, I felt that there was something wrong with me(tired, fatigue, brain fog), like 100%, but also I was like I‚Äôm just anxious and I‚Äôm in that cycle

Got a full blood test and guess what, VIT D was at 21(recommended: 30-100); takes me back to my first panic attack when I was in Manchester, and I was holed up in my room for a whole ass month without going outside(literally no exposure to sunlight)

Did not believe that my vitamin deficiency could lead to any of the symptoms I had been feeling more acutely since the past couple of months

Started supplementation and guess what, 12 days later, I‚Äôve started feeling slightly better, I‚Äôm a lot more of control in my thoughts, do not have brain fog, no dizzy spells, I‚Äôm sleeping like a baby

Do I still get anxious? Sure, Is it scary? Eh not as much, Do I get over it quickly? Fuck yes

I understand that this might just be me and a handful of people but a lot of times, there might be certain factors which are malleable and one of them is your health

Go get those vitamin levels checked, get a basic health checkup, eat healthy, workout and hopefully everything goes in your favour!

I Almost Quit My Job in Silence But Then My Coworker Said One Sentence That Stopped Me,"Hi everyone,

I haven‚Äôt really talked about this before, but last week I reached a breaking point. I‚Äôve been juggling way too much for too long work deadlines, family pressure, personal stuff. I‚Äôd been pretending I was okay, smiling through meetings, replying ‚ÄúAll good‚Äù when it wasn‚Äôt.

But inside, I was completely drained. No energy. No peace. Just survival mode on repeat.

That day, I stayed back late again. I opened a Word doc to type my resignation  not because I had a plan, but because I just couldn‚Äôt keep faking it anymore.

Then a coworker  someone I barely talk to  came by to grab their things. She paused, looked at me, and quietly said:
‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt always have to be the strong one.‚Äù

And for some reason, that broke me.

Not in a bad way  it was the first time in a long time someone saw me without me having to explain or prove anything.

We ended up talking for half an hour. She shared her own experience with burnout. No judgment, no pressure. Just honesty. And for the first time in weeks, I didn‚Äôt feel alone.

I still haven‚Äôt made a final decision about work. But I‚Äôm taking some time to rest. And I just want to say
If you‚Äôre overwhelmed, you‚Äôre not weak. You‚Äôre human.
You don‚Äôt always have to carry it alone.

It's not just a ""adjustment phase"" if someone hasn't slept for four days and feels like they're losing control; that's a serious warning sign. I find it surprising that some members of this community still take the time to offer wise counsel and demonstrate genuine compassion.

I believe the best way to approach it would to combat the panic disorder, and I'm gonna be starting intensive in person therapy. I've been doing virtual since I got insurance and my old place didn't take it just as a way to maintain consistency, but it's definitely not the best option for me.

"Anxiety is ruining my life, i'm lost","( srry if my eng isnt that good ) 
Like many of you, anxiety never leaves me. I live in constant fear and anxiety. I hardly ever leave my house ( i work in freelance ). My anxiety has reached such a point that, for many years now, it has caused me a variety of severe physical pains. For 2 years I've had medical examinations due to hormonal pain which were flawed because of my anxiety symptoms (I was diagnosed with endometriosis at the end). These medical appointments didn't go so well and they left me even more mentally exhausted. Now I often have anxiety attacks and phobias that I didn't have before. I've been to many psychologists in my life, but they've never really helped me. For 3 years I was on anti-anxiety medication but it was a disaster.

 It was as if the further I got into my life, the less I saw the end of it. I can't find any concrete solutions. I feel as if my anxieties are never going to leave me but are always going to grow. Sometimes I'm so tired that I think about dying (I don't want to, but I'm fed up with myself). I'm lucky to have my family and my boyfriend who are there for me and try to help me. But I just can't.

How do you handle the constant *what if‚Äù*thoughts without spiraling?,"Hi everyone,

I‚Äôve been struggling lately with nonstop ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù thoughts , like, \*What if I embarrass myself?\* \*What if I mess up at work?\* \*What if something bad happens to my family?\*

I know logically that worrying doesn‚Äôt change anything, but it feels like my brain just grabs onto worst case scenarios and won‚Äôt let go.

I‚Äôm working with a therapist (so I‚Äôm not looking for medical advice), but I‚Äôd really appreciate hearing how others here cope in the moment when the thoughts are overwhelming.

Grounding techniques? Mantras? Anything that helps you break the cycle without reassurance seeking?

"I‚Äôve been going through derealization where it feels like I‚Äôm in a different environment, even though I know the place very well","
So lately I‚Äôve been experiencing what I think is derealization. It only happens in my room, usually when I sit down to study. I suddenly feel like I‚Äôm in a different version of my room ‚Äî like everything is the same, but it doesn‚Äôt feel familiar anymore. Almost like I‚Äôm seeing it for the first time, even though I‚Äôve been there thousands of times.

It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm blacking out or unaware ‚Äî I know I‚Äôm in my room and what I‚Äôm doing, but the vibe or feel of the place shifts, like I‚Äôm in an alternate layer of reality.

It was uncomfortable, so I started doing a few small things to help pull myself back:

I play music ‚Äî it helps bring some normalcy and anchors my mind.

I describe the room out loud or in my head: ‚ÄúThis is my desk, the wall is this color, my book is here.‚Äù

I added a small change to my environment ‚Äî like spraying a nice perfume or changing lighting. That ‚Äúnewness‚Äù helps snap me back.

And honestly, just believing in myself and reminding myself that I‚Äôm safe and it‚Äôs temporary has helped a lot.

hi there, 
for the past 2 weeks i‚Äôve had this horrific feeling of dread that i‚Äôm going to die by sunday. never in my life have i felt this genuine fear and certainty before, although i do really struggle with anxiety and i have struggled with it all my life. i‚Äôll often think thoughts of death but will always think past in thinking ‚Äòit‚Äôll never happen im fine‚Äô. but these past 2 weeks have been really difficult and hard. i have this feeling that im going to actually die and that i can‚Äôt do anything to stop it. i want it to stop but i cant seek help anywhere. ive tried to blame it on things but for some reason i can‚Äôt pinpoint what the cause is. 

the worst part of the feeling is thinking of this time next week and onwards. i keep thinking i wont be here to even experience it. like, my friend or family will say something about the winter or something and in my head i‚Äôll think ‚Äòi wont even be here to experience it‚Äô. 
its genuinely the worst feeling i think i‚Äôve ever experienced and i desperately want some help to comfort myself. 


i‚Äôm going on a short trip abroad (from london to greece) on Thursday, im going with my best mate and her parents - it‚Äôll be the first time i have been on a flight for the first time in a year and abroad without a parent, since i barely choose to go on holidays. i felt really pressured to go since everything was paid for, all i had to buy was the tickets for my flight. this is what triggered the thoughts. i thought maybe the plane was going to have something to do with dying, or i wont be able to get home but then i deep it and think: ‚Äòbut why wouldn‚Äôt i be able to get home?‚Äô and then i leave myself really confused.

does anyone know how i could change my mindset? any thoughts are really appreciated, thank u so so much!

Thinking of IOP,"Hi!

I (25F) have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember, and was officially diagnosed when I was in elementary school. I didn‚Äôt speak to anyone outside of my family or my teachers (with the exception of one friend) until I was 10 years old, and while my social anxiety has dissipated some, my existential anxiety has gone through the roof in the last few years. I struggle to maintain my personal relationships due to persistent paranoia, and my professional relationships are lacking due to the social anxiety and imposter syndrome I have yet to shake.

My boyfriend of 6 years is likely going to end our relationship because of my incessant worrying about the future and constant need for reassurance that he wants to be with me. My best friends have heard the same story for years, and though they have made it clear they will always be there for me, I am extremely concerned that they are fed up with the cycle I‚Äôm in and will soon step back from our friendship. I am hyper aware of the way my thought patterns and subsequent actions are impacting my relationships, and even after years of acknowledging my destructive habits, I have not found a way to prevent myself from continuing down this path.

I don‚Äôt identify as being insecure, but my actions say otherwise. Being alone is one of my biggest fears and I am so worried that‚Äôs where I‚Äôm headed. I am very willing to put in the work needed to better myself, I think I just haven‚Äôt found a good place to start.

With that being said, I‚Äôm curious if anyone has experience with IOP, and can share some insight into what it did or did not do for you. Also, how did you handle taking time off of work to attend IOP (if applicable)? I know some facilities offer evening programs, but the ones in my insurance network appear to take place during my business hours. If you are someone who has struggled with severe relationship (romantic or platonic) anxiety, what are some habits you picked up or adjustments you made to alleviate some of the burden the anxiety has brought onto you?

TIA :)

My biggest struggle is health anxiety.,"all started when I developed a deep fear of death at the age of 14. Nothing seems to convince me not to be scared, especially since this fear is tied to religion i got deep into it and it will never change. Whenever I feel something unusual, I turn to Google ‚Äî it's like my best friend during these episodes. I google every symptom obsessively.
Because of all this, I wake up feeling genuinely sick every single day. The nausea hits me all day long, along with some really uncomfortable digestive issues. I constantly feel off balance, unless I stay lying in bed. My heart also beats irregularly ‚Äî it feels strange and unpredictable almost every day.

Every day brings new sensations, new symptoms. I've booked countless medical appointments, but it's never enough to ease my mind.

‚ö´Ô∏èI‚Äôve convinced myself I‚Äôm going to faint whenever I feel dizzy or off-balance in public. 

‚ö´Ô∏èI deal with chronic nausea and constantly fear that I‚Äôm going to throw up or die (vomiting is one of my biggest phobias)

‚ö´Ô∏èSometimes I‚Äôm convinced I‚Äôm choking because I feel like there‚Äôs mucus stuck in my throat. 

‚ö´Ô∏èIf I eat something  whatever, I panic and think I‚Äôll have an allergic reaction and my throat will close up.

‚ö´Ô∏èI also avoid taking any medications because I‚Äôm terrified of having side effects or a severe allergic reaction. The fear of something going wrong overwhelms me, so I‚Äôd rather deal with the symptoms than risk trying medicine.

‚ö´Ô∏èI‚Äôve convinced myself I‚Äôve had heart attacks because of the skipped heartbeats, rapid heart rate, and a heavy pressure in my chest.


‚ö´Ô∏èI was also convinced I might have a brain aneurysm whenever I experienced a sudden headache, or that I had a brain tumor.

‚ö´Ô∏è I constantly check my face in the mirror to make sure it‚Äôs not paralyzed, in case I‚Äôm having a stroke.




The hardest part is that I can't even afford therapy  I simply don't have the money. So I'm reaching out here, hoping someone can help me.




Right now, I feel like I‚Äôll never heal from this.

Wellbutrin,"Hi all,

I was on Zoloft for 6ish years and it definitely helped my anxiety but killed my libido. I thought I had my anxiety under control so I decided to stop it. Ya- that was a mistake. 6 months later (current) I‚Äôve had a really awful flare up and I‚Äôm suffering pretty badly from anxiety right now. 

My doctor recommended I try Wellbutrin to address the anxiety without having the negative sexual effects. It‚Äôs been less than 2 weeks (2 weeks tomorrow), and I‚Äôve been really struggling- having to take Xanax daily to get through. I‚Äôve been told it takes about 4 weeks for it to get better but I‚Äôm really worried (anxious about being anxious) that I‚Äôll make it to 4 weeks (and that will be hard), it won‚Äôt work, then I‚Äôll have to end up switching to Zoloft anyway and that‚Äôs like another month after that to feel the effects of Zoloft.

28 Weeks on Sertraline ‚Äì Still No Stability. Looking for Guidance,"Hi everyone,

First-time poster here. I‚Äôm a 33-year-old male, and I‚Äôve been on 75mg of sertraline (Zoloft) for 28 weeks now (almost 7 months). I started during a dark period ‚Äî severe anxiety, DP/DR, intrusive thoughts, anhedonia ‚Äî and was later diagnosed with C-PTSD.

Since then, I've had a few ‚Äúokay‚Äù days, but they‚Äôre rare and short-lived. Around Month 4, I began to notice some improvement, and again at the start of June, but nothing has really stuck. My mood is still unstable ‚Äî some days I feel jittery or overly wired, others bring on depression or anxiety seemingly out of nowhere.

Right now, I‚Äôm dealing with frequent mood swings, intrusive thoughts, and a lack of pleasure. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs the medication causing this emotional rollercoaster or just my brain trying to recover. I‚Äôve never experienced this kind of cycling before starting the SSRI.

That said, there¬†*have*¬†been some positives ‚Äî better sleep, a bit more energy, and I‚Äôm less reactive to my thoughts. But part of me wonders if that‚Äôs the med working‚Ä¶ or just placebo. To tell you I could not function on December, in February I was back to work and social activities,. However,  I am oftenfeeling off when engaging.

Deep down, I feel my actual dose might not be the right fit ‚Äî especially when I read stories of people who¬†*know*¬†when they‚Äôve found their med.

So I‚Äôm left wondering since I will meet my psychiatrist in a couple of weeks / what do you think of these scenarios ?

* Should I increase the dose?
* Add something like Wellbutrin?
* Taper off?
* Or just give it more time?

  
Is there anyone who have a similar timeline / story ? 

Thanks so much for reading ‚Äî any advice or shared experience means a lot. Thanks for taking care of others.

best regards,

H.

I stopped Zoloft 2 months ago for my anxiety and have seem to have become depressed. What gives?,"I want to add some backstory that may or may not help for the long term of how my brain functions. It's a tad long so if you want to read please do otherwise **TL;DR** at the bottom. I had a ""plan"" for a majority of my life. Basically someone always telling me what to do and ideally when to do it. Milestones in life like going to school k-12, then college, then marriage and then kids. For me K-12 was just an obvious yeah your going to keep moving up. I mean yeah I *could* repeat another grade but that's unlikely. 



After High School I went to college and then well I look back and I think that's where things started albeit on a much smaller scale that was unnoticeable. I wasn't the brightest kid throughout my life, hell I had modified tests (I needed an extra 5 mins to truly understand the problem being asked that I need to solve where everyone else gets it right away its hard to explain), was always the kid that was picked on until high school and when I found out I wasn't getting into other 4 year colleges with friends I've known my entire life and even just others I've known it killed me. I went to community college and worked at the same time. It just kinda felt like a continuation of HS and after 2 years I got into a 4yr university. Well that was a bomb shell because I was still working 40hrs + 18 credit hours and then it forced my grades to nothing. After work and school I didn't want to study more I wanted to just decompress which clearly was my downfall. Well fast forward the end of my 5th year and I was failing a class that I needed in order to graduate. It was the second time I was taking it. I passed by the skin of my teeth, but leading up into that I developed anxiety. I didn't even know what that was until then. Honest never heard of it, never experienced it etc. I started having the physical symptoms, heavy chest like I couldn't breathe, to the feeling of drinking 1000 energy drinks and pacing back and forth where I eventually passed out after the adrenaline wore off. Post graduation, I was still living in the apartment as I had a job from an internship. Everyone else moved back home and I was all alone. It was horrible. Anxiety attacks left and right.



That summer I knew I was going to ask my then girlfriend to marry me as that was ""the plan"" as I told myself you can't ask until you graduate. Well after the proposal I moved back home or rather in with her and felt a tad more at ease, but my career was crap. I went to school with the mindset like everyone teaches you you'll get a good job after college and work your way up. I got 2 jobs that I was both fired from after only a month or two because I didn't meet their standards and no one wanted to teach me (I was literally the only person in IT at both places so room for growth was null). As you can imagine that was a blow to my self-esteem on-top of everything else I've been experiencing. By this point I finally started zoloft (25mg). I've never taken meds outside of something for the flu so it was a weird time for me. I was still having anxiety attacks, but they were a tad more in-line. Eventually I went up to 75mg (tbh I can't remember when) but I also had a job I enjoyed and worked at for a bit and eventually got hired at another place for the following 5 years. 



Sadly shit hit the fan right before COVID and found out for a majority of the time I was with my then wife she was cheating on me with multiple people for YEARS. As you can imagine my world fell apart and I tried therapy for us both and also for myself. 1 year in and I called it quits as she had no desire to be with me. I took the step to move home and continue therapy.

  
Since then I've been in therapy and I can safely say even with the few different therapist (due to insurance change or affordability nothing wrong with any of the therapists themselves) and friends and family have said I've come an extremely long way and have all agreed that I've moved on. Now the issue with that is I've moved on from her. Truthfully I have. What I seem to have not moved on from was structure. Remember I said someone like my parents always made a plan for me. Go to school, pack your lunch, do soccer on the weekends, (I would make plans to hand with friends as I got old enough dont worry) and just a general sense that the ""world"" would take care of me as long as I did what was required. Well clearly life had other plans as you can see so I started wondering wtf am I even doing with myself? and now we've arrived to the last 6 months or so.

  
**TL;DR - a majority of my life someone else created a structure for me that I blindly followed and when I got to the end shit hit the fan from job losses to my ex having multiple affairs.**



I've had a great job for the last 2 years or so as it was the first time I felt accepted into a place that actually gave a shit about its employees. The friendliness, the fun banter, the pay, the ability to pay for certifications etc. Well I was in such a good place earlier this year I decided to work with my doctor and my therapist and inform them I'd like to start coming off my meds. I believed they served their purpose (the anxiety) for that part of my life. I was on them for about 9 years. I didn't enjoy how they made me forget things long term wise and that's really the only side effect I've ever had with them. So for the next 3 months I did 75mg every other day for a month, and then drop down to 50mg the following month to finally 25mg. Everything went well. The first week or two after the final 25mg I got brain zaps and just felt ""off"", but the brain zaps did go away. Now though for the last month maybe 2 I've just felt tired, and disconnected at times. Not a full disassociation or where I can see myself in third person, just I'm a rock watching time go by. From what I've gathered for myself and my therapist and some friends and family, I'm depressed. I've started to wonder if zoloft caused this or was the zoloft just masking it since post college graduation. I say that time because it was the last ""structured"" goal I had. I've had others that I've completed since like get a new car on my own, my own home, have dogs, work on some personal tech stuff I enjoy, but now I just don't know whats wrong with me. Ideally I don't want to go back on meds as I also don't think enough time has passed yet to fully determine that, but it has made me wonder if Zoloft gave me depression and this will eventually go away or is this now permanent. I fucking hate this feeling. I'm tired a lot, I'm just bleh half the time and a lot of things I used to enjoy now I just do them like a zombie. Don't get me wrong, I do laugh and enjoy stuff still, but its more 80 depressed/20 every other feeling now. It does seem like I'm going through life now without a goal/purpose and thats whats causing this feeling of depression.

  
So my question is, has zoloft or any other SSRI once you've come off it and have been off it since for Anxiety made you feel this way? If it did what steps did you take to overcome it and feel like yourself again. I'm aware everyone is different, but I just like to hear from others that I'm not alone in this feeling and there is something that can be done to help with this. Thank you

really long panic attack??,"So I‚Äôm 18, and I‚Äôve been under a crazy amount of stress lately. I‚Äôm diagnosed with pretty severe anxiety and take a couple medications for it. I have a history of panic attacks, but i‚Äôve never had anything like this and i‚Äôm starting to become really paranoid if maybe it‚Äôs not a panic attack and something wrong because it‚Äôs been a day now. 

Yesterday I was out of state with family and really stressed out, but ultimately fine. Everything was good but I suddenly got a tight feeling in my upper chest around my neck and my face got kind of hot and tingly and my hands and tongue went numb. I couldn‚Äôt breathe and was taking deep breaths and got really scared because I couldn‚Äôt breathe. It went away for about ten minutes, we got back in the car to drive home, and it came back a lot worse. I started freaking out because I thought I couldn‚Äôt breathe and I was shaking like crazy and crying hyperventilating but eventually calmed down. The whole hour car ride was like this where I would get it under control by reminding myself there‚Äôs no reason I can‚Äôt breathe, and then it would randomly come back in waves with a pang of anxiety. I felt a lot better after an hour and even went out with friends and was completely fine the rest of the night and this morning. 
Now it‚Äôs lightly coming back where I keep getting a really bad feeling and struggle to breathe a little bit, taking deep breaths and reminding myself I can breathe and there‚Äôs no reason I can‚Äôt. I think I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs going to happen again. I‚Äôm so exhausted to top it all off. 

All of these factors are symptoms of panic attacks I‚Äôve had in the past, the numbness is particularly something I‚Äôve discussed with my psychiatrist, I‚Äôve just never had them so extreme‚Äîit‚Äôs making me worry that something medically could be wrong. I think this worry is also making it worse. It‚Äôs not an issue when i‚Äôm distracted, but the moment i‚Äôm not doing anything it comes back. I‚Äôm not sure what to do.

Has anyone else experienced this? It‚Äôs freaking me out a lot. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just because i‚Äôm scared of having another panic attack that severe, because i‚Äôm too conscious of my breathing, or if there‚Äôs something possibly genuinely wrong. My mom is no help because all she does is yell at me and punish me for my issues with anxiety. She doesn‚Äôt believe me at all lol


Also unsure if this is relevant‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to detail my current situation but I ran out of my main medication, wellbutrin, and they wouldn‚Äôt refill it unless I made an appointment and it‚Äôs always been difficult for me to get in. I‚Äôve been so busy lately I haven‚Äôt been able to reschedule an appointment that will work for me so I slowly stopped taking it the past two weeks after I went from 150MG (in the past i took 350 but downsized with my psychiatrist bc it was giving me paranoia and minor hallucinations), then started taking my 75 MG, etc until I stopped taking it entirely. Not sure if this could be affecting anything‚ÄîI‚Äôve been completely fine though in terms of this otherwise and still take my other medicine.

Anxiety - dating app,"Posting this here as hoping it's just anxiety playing up! Can be difficult to see straight sometimes! Hoping someone who has used tinder can't help.

About 10 years ago I had a tinder account that I'm pretty sure I deleted, but having an anxious day and thought I needed to double check its gone.

I was prompted to create a new one when I went on the app (new phone) 'sign in with facebook' so did so, went through the steps and deleted the account, however my phone is a little dodgy and I didn't get the confirmation button after I pressed delete. I then started up the app and did the same i.e. 'sign in with facebook' again (I'm thinking surely if not deleted it would go straight to the same profile I just created?). And then created again and deleted, this time getting confirmation of deletion through the app. Before creating both those accounts I removed all photos obviously that had auto populated after linking to FB.

I obviously only ever had one Facebook, and so am worried I may still have the tinder Account! Any advice or help appreciated!",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lnoirq/anxiety_dating_app/,1751228446.0,anxiety

birthday anxiety,"so for context: i‚Äôm 16(f) about to turn 17 and tomorrow is my birthday. i‚Äôve been struggling with pretty severe anxiety and depression throughout this past year, and recently my therapist told me that she thinks i have OCD (but mostly internal like the pure O and it‚Äôs frequently related to morality) and we‚Äôre making plans to get me on some kind of ssri in the near future. 

back to the topic: i used to really enjoy my birthday, despite being pretty anxious whenever the day would come. for this birthday however, i want to do absolutely nothing. after weeks of debating and threatening to cancel i finally decided that since my friends and family would like to celebrate my birthday, i‚Äôll agree to something simple like dinner and watching a movie at my house. that way we‚Äôll be in public (so less attention on just me) and we‚Äôll be watching a movie (again less attention on me). however when i went upstairs this morning to get breakfast after already struggling to get out of bed and take a shower and just get myself generally excited for today, i discovered that my mom completely decorated the living room where we‚Äôll watch the movie with birthday decor and streamers and lights and so on. i wanted to keep it super lowkey, and having decorations is definitely NOT lowkey, so now i‚Äôm even more anxious and thinking about canceling the whole evening. i didn‚Äôt ask her to do that (although technically i never specified that i didn‚Äôt want decorations) and i don‚Äôt want to hurt her feelings. i‚Äôm grateful that she cares enough to celebrate me, believe me i‚Äôm so so grateful and lucky, but my anxiety and depression are just constantly convincing me that it‚Äôll be embarrassing and that i‚Äôll do or say something stupid with all of those bright shiny decorations. i really just wanted to do this to appease the people i care about and that‚Äôs it, so this just all feels like too much. it totally derailed my morning and now idk what to do. i can‚Äôt face her and ask her to help me take it down because i‚Äôll just end up hurting her feelings and she won‚Äôt understand. honestly i just wish humans didn‚Äôt celebrate birthdays at all it would make things so much easier. so i guess i‚Äôm just asking for advice on how to handle this like a normal human being and just wondering if anyone else has experienced anxiety around their birthday ‚òπÔ∏è",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lnnv9r/birthday_anxiety/,1751226814.0,anxiety
I sold my Glastonbury ticket and i hate myself,"
Last year I went to glasto for the first time. First ever festival At 27 years old. This year I was lucky enough to get another ticket.

I had a few issues with the group I was going with before I had to pay the full amount. I didn't feel they had been treating me particularly well, I felt I didn't want to ruin the memory of the year before. It was a lot of money. And the lineup wasn't massively to my taste. plus like 90% of the people who usually go weren‚Äôt going. So seemed like the right idea at the time

This week watching it happen has honestly been more painful that I could possibly imagine. It's triggered so much anxiety in me. It's made me realise how unhappy I've been. It's made me realise my friends have all drifted away from me. It's put my age in perspective. It's made me worry so so much.

I told them I had a work trip and I screwed up, hadn't booked the leave and couldn't get out of it. I didn't know what else to say. I didn't want to insult them but genuinely at the time I wasnt going ahead with it because I felt they'd ruin the memory for me. A completely stupid stupid thought and frankly I'm so angry at myself for that.

I'll be 30 next time it comes around. If I even get a ticket. Tickets are so hard to get. They are the one group that's ever wanted to try for tickets with me. What if they don't want me next time? What if they don't want to go next time? 2 years is a long time and I barely seen them anyway outside of Glastonbury anymore. My other friends have 0 interest.

I hate myself for this. Genuinely despise myself. And I can't let go of it. The number of years I've spent wishing I could do stuff like this, just to chuck it away. I'm worried how this is going to effect me going forward.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lnicom/i_sold_my_glastonbury_ticket_and_i_hate_myself/,1751213227.0,anxiety

Inner Critic advice,"So one of my issues was, my anxiety mutated my inner critic into a into a full blown self hatred eltrich horror, and just wrecked me. Anxiety episodes turn into blown extreme end what ifs and I got rattled like debilitating. IE arguing with boss ends in me on death row. (only crime I did in these scenarios was I exist)

Then I tried something, I gave it form.... then I envisioned me battling it. (Going full Kratos) it slink away try and ambush but it got smaller and less effective each battle, now it's fairly tame. 

Point is if your inner critic has mutated to this level. This is one strategy. It won't eliminate anxiety but at least your self hatred/ end time what ifs aren't as powerful.

Stopping my medication and doubting my diagnosis,"(Next week I have an appointment with my psychologist so I will tell her everything.)

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my situation and maybe get some outside perspectives, because I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm making the right choices.

I stopped taking venlafaxine (225 mg daily) completely, without consulting my psychiatrist. It was my own decision. The reason is that I recently started thinking I might have never actually been mentally ill in the first place.

One of the things that really pushed me to stop taking it was that I recently learned if someone with a healthy brain (no real mental disorder, no actual chemical imbalance) starts taking psychiatric meds, it could potentially mess up their brain chemistry and even make things worse. That freaked me out. It made me think: What if my brain was fine and now I‚Äôve actually harmed it?

Back in 2023, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety. At that time, I did struggle with:

I constantly overthink. I replay things that happened in the past, especially moments when I felt embarrassed or like I messed up. I also worry a lot about the future - that I‚Äôll fail, that I‚Äôll disappoint people, that nothing will work out.

I‚Äôm very sensitive to what others think of me. I worry people don‚Äôt like me, or that they secretly laugh at me behind my back. Even going to a store or passing people on the street makes me nervous because I feel ugly or like everyone is judging me.

Social situations stress me out. I avoided them not because I was completely terrified, but because they made me anxious and uncomfortable. I‚Äôd sometimes shake or have racing thoughts. Still, I pushed myself to go when I had to. For example, to school, to university, to appointments - mostly because I didn‚Äôt want people to be mad at me or think badly of me.

I often feel this emptiness inside. Even when I‚Äôm doing something fun or feel happy, there‚Äôs still a sad, hollow feeling in the background, like life doesn‚Äôt really have a point.

I‚Äôve also had suicidal thoughts for a long time. It wasn‚Äôt just wishing I didn‚Äôt exist. Many times I had actual thoughts about how I could do it, and serious moments where I really wanted to die. Sometimes plans would come into my head, not just vague ideas. It was more than just a passing thought. It felt like a real way out of everything or thinking I‚Äôd press a button to stop existing if that was possible.

All of this is tied to my low self-esteem and feeling stuck in a body and mind that I hate.

Sometimes I‚Äôm so mentally tired that I just want to lie in bed and do nothing. There were days like that, but I still got up when I had to.

I sometimes neglect things like washing my hair. I also don‚Äôt eat properly - I wait for someone else to make food, or just eat random stuff.

Even with all of this, I can still enjoy things. I do have interests and they make me happy, even if that sadness is always somewhere in the background.

People around me have told me that something seems wrong, based on the way I write or talk about things. They‚Äôve said it‚Äôs clear I‚Äôm not completely okay.

A lot of this probably comes from feeling alone, worrying about the future, or not having a relationship - I‚Äôve never been in one and feel like nobody would ever like me. It‚Äôs also tied to bigger, existential fears, like what‚Äôs the point of life at all.

Because of that, I started wondering if I unintentionally exaggerated my symptoms, and maybe that led the psychiatrist to misdiagnose me. In 2024, I didn‚Äôt see any mental health professionals at all. It wasn‚Äôt until January 2025 that I started therapy and saw a psychiatrist again, who prescribed me venlafaxine.

THE ESSENCE IS: these symptoms are not strong enough, I still do everything other healthy people do, and I function normally, I am NOT sad all the time and I am able to feel joy, there are moments where I do not feel anxiety and everything is okay.

 So I do not have any disorders and my conclusions: I SIMPLY HAVE LOW SELF-ESTEEM, EXISTENTIAL EMPTINESS AND SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO MENTAL DISORDERS BUT I DO NOT MEET THE IMPORTANT SYMPTOMS.

Since then, the only real improvement was that my anxiety seemed slightly better. But the suicidal thoughts and general emptiness never went away. That‚Äôs part of why I just decided to quit taking it.

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for thoughts from people who‚Äôve been in similar situations. How did you figure out if your diagnosis was accurate? Did you ever feel like you might have misrepresented your symptoms?

It doesn‚Äôt feel muscular and I can feel that it‚Äôs definitely associated with my breathing. Side note: I also have spinal pain (upper spine) for a year now and an MRI showed nothing. 

I know X-rays aren‚Äôt always accurate in detecting lung cancer, so I feel that I need a ct scan. Only issue is that doctors aren‚Äôt really taking me seriously because if I‚Äôm being honest, I have OCD and it causes me to become anxiously obsessed with whatever topic I‚Äôm on. I don‚Äôt want another X-ray so I don‚Äôt want to go to urgent care, and my doctor can‚Äôt see me for another month. The symptoms are definitely there and my anxiety isn‚Äôt creating them. Between doctors, being sick, and my anxiety, I‚Äôm going crazy üò£ I appreciate anyone who gives their advice. Thanks!

Anxiety of AI taking my job,"I have an irrational fear of losing my job or career forever to AI. I grew up poor and struggled to get my first corporate role. However, I've been in this field for 8 years now. Still, I'm extremely scared I'll lose my job or feel like I shouldn't have been in it at all. (I'm 35 and work in finance in a very high-paying position, but I only landed this job when I was 27). Before that, I was on a low-skilled track and didn't speak English. 

I'm anxious because I don't have it in me to shift careers again. I just want to retire ASAP. But the issue is that I support half of my family. So despite making a lot of money, I get to save less than 20% of it. If AI takes over, all of my family will be unemployed. It will be over. Just a few months ago one of my close friends who wen to an ivy league and worked a good job, was fired because of AI.

  
Is anyone scared on their day to day about being unemployed from AI? I try to keep up with AI and use it to help me in my job. And it is helpful. But it's so helpful that I'm literally confused why it hasn't already taken my job? ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lnkpgy/anxiety_of_ai_taking_my_job/,1751219033.0,anxiety
"Anxiety nearing paranoia, hallucinations(?), and sleep issues, looking to hear from others","My anxiety disorder that I have been dealing with for years now has taken a strange direction. I find it hard to sleep at night without paranoia and fear of every little thing around me, and other things that I don't know how to describe other than ""almost hallucinations"", like I didn't see or hear something but I can swear I did. Night time is the worst, it is just so scary. I can't look at dark areas, there is a small light on, my curtain has to be shut all the way without any visible cracks, and I need some kind of noise. I wake up suddenly in fear often, and see insects crawling on myself. I've woken up to see weird shit in my window or to things being loudly whispered to me. Could very well be just me being sleepy and delirious but it freaks me out. Only things I am diagnosed with are depression and anxiety and I don't think it is really anything else causing this. I am not on any medication and I don't plan on taking any.

I struggle with my regular overthinking and worrying day to day, but this only really occurs at night if I am alone. I wanted to see if anyone else has felt similarly, and maybe advice on how to manage it.",6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lnb7a4/anxiety_nearing_paranoia_hallucinations_and_sleep/,1751191841.0,anxiety

I have a bad habit of falling in love with everyone I see,"I have a bad habit of falling in love with every attractive person I meet.  If I think someone is pretty, I instantly just notice everything I love about them and think about what life could be like with them.  I think about cute things we do and what it could be like, even if I never have a chance of being with them.  Not quite every single person maybe or to the same degree, but a lot with the ones that have some qualities or idiosyncrasies that I like.  Then I get sad because of course it's never happening and anxious because I don't have it and want it.  And of course this happens with pretty much every attractive person I see.  Dating in general gives me anxiety because it's just so stressful.  I find it frustrating and difficult in general, but I want to be in a relationship and finding love is one of the main things I want in life.  I've been in many relationships before, but nothing has worked out quite the way I want.  I'm an impatient person so living day to day with the frustration of dating and this whole imagining life with every attraction stranger just makes me feel terrible.",3,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lnayph/i_have_a_bad_habit_of_falling_in_love_with/,1751190902.0,anxiety

Side effects on Lexapro,,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lnipda/side_effects_on_lexapro/,1751214116.0,anxiety
Doubts about starting on anxiety medication (lexapro),"Hi everyone. 

I'll try to make this as brief as possible. I am 20f and got prescribed medication (lexapro, starting with 5mg and then 10mg) for my persisting anxiety after being referred to a psichyatrist in the psychological clinic I attend to. 

I know I am a very anxious person, I have episodes once in a while where I spent like 3 days being misserable over a little thing, can't sleep, have muscle pain, can't concentrate, can't meet deadlines (even though I spend like 70% of my awake time worrying about them), but I will say it has definitely gotten better on the last two years. 

Before, I was so afraid to go to school. I used to run to the bathroom as often as possible to avoid talking to people. Whenever I had a free block I would start desesperately looking for a hiding spot to avoid being seen. I would get to college but could not get myself out of the car if I was specially worried that day. 

I don't do anything of the sort anymore. I am a teacher now, I have become a little bit better at functioning even though I still worry about a lot of things excessively. I now am on break from school so things have been great. 

Looking back I clearly needed help. It would have been awesome if it was delivered to me, but I am really worried I don't need it anymore and have spent hours looking for information on the side effects and possible outcomes for treating GAD. It sounds awesome to be anxiety free all the time, but should I give it a shot even knowing that I am mostly functional now? Or will that just fuck up my progress? 

I have been on therapy for 6 months. I definetely plan to keep going. I talked briefly about these concerns with both my psychiatrist and psychologist and they told me to give it a shot but I've been reeding a lot about how hard on the body it is to quit? 

I think the stigma about mental health has gotten to me and I'm not sure if I want to be medicated or if I need it. I am also worried about gaslighting (I don't know if I gaslighted my doctors into thinking I need medication or if I'm gaslighting me into thinking I don't) HELP 

It would be great if you shared your experiences with medication with me, and your opinion of this whole shebang. Anything would be appreciated, thank you very much for reading. Have a great day

romantic affection of any kind makes my anxiety sky rocket.,"So before I go into details, yes I have been going to therapy for more than a year now and have been trying to improve myself in multiple ways when it comes to taking care of my anxiety. 

But one thing that is still a persistent issue that I have been struggling with is, any kind of affection in a romantic sense, really makes me unbelievably anxious. Like feeling ill type of anxiety. I have tried to describe this to friends and my therapist and most don't really get it. But for me it basically goes like this. 

When it comes to my platonic or familial relationships, I really don't have any issue with either verbal or physical affection, I say I love you to both close friends and family, I always give hugs to both too. No issue at all. But I wouldn't really ever do those things to a stranger or person I barely know. Because for me, saying or doing any of those things is me expressing how I feel about them. 

But when it comes to any kind of affection in a romantic scenario it just gives me this debilitating anxiety. For me a lot of the time whenever I have been on dates or in my past attempts at relationships, it ended up with this weird confusion where I am always questioning why they are flirting with me or why they are touching me, etc. I will say my last relationship was a wreck because the girl I was with was love bombing me a lot and things got sexual really quickly but whenever I asked ""what are we"" it was always vague non-answers. So I just ended up feeling as though I was just used for gratification. 

Honestly not sure how to ""fix"" or get over this anxiety because I want to not feel this way but its one of the worst manifestations of my anxiety. ",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lngvy5/romantic_affection_of_any_kind_makes_my_anxiety/,1751209549.0,anxiety

New to anxiety,"I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder three weeks ago. ( that‚Äôs two months after my older sister was diagnosed with bipolar disease) Since then, I‚Äôve been taking Escitalopram 10 mg once a day, and Clonazepam‚Äî1 tablet daily for the first week, then only when needed.
The first week and a half went well in terms of reducing panic attacks and improving sleep. I only experienced some morning nausea, acid reflux, loss of appetite and occasional vomiting which have now become less frequent.
However, over the past week and a half, things have changed. The panic attacks have returned, becoming more frequent and lasting longer. I‚Äôve also been experiencing increased fear, numbness in the skin of my arms and legs, and back pain. Despite that, the symptoms were still tolerable, and taking half a tablet of Clonazepam helped me sleep.
Now, over the last two days, I‚Äôve been feeling constantly anxious and fearful, with an increased heart rate and a stronger urge to smoke. During the first week, I barely thought about smoking and only had around four cigarettes a day, but in the past two days, it‚Äôs been over ten. I‚Äôve also been spending a lot of time online researching various mental illnesses‚Äîranging from depression to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
Can anyone help me process what‚Äôs going on?
