I really am just fed up of mental illness,"Im 41, 42 november. also have a learning disability. I have never had a relationship ever.

part of my issue is that i really am only attracted to muscular women. Idk why, I just am. And Ive tried so hard to look past it and tried to date people not muscular, but I just always kind of resented it and felt like i never wanted to be physical with them so it never went anywhere. I wish i could help it. Ive tried everywhere. Ive looked everywhere. In gyms, online, dating sites, etc. no luck.

its worse because im fat. And its a cycle. I decide to try to get in shape, make some progress, then depression hits and i get fatter when i eat using comfort food. I dont have a career , i make no money because my depressions so bad i cant work. And my country is told to see us with mental health issues as “just making it up” or can just work through it when the truth is i cant even cope with every day things.

how could i ever expect an athletic woman to want me? And whenever i try to improve my life it goes wrong because my depressions always there. Its always waiting . And its exhausting. Im so tired of life. Im here for my older brother and sister but when they pass as they are both decades older i dont see myself staying.

im so alone and nothing i can do can help me. I wish i could just find a muscular woman who liked me snd didnt care i wasnt rich and maybe we could work out together . Maybe that would help because even tho people say love yourself i promise you when youve missed out in major milestones in human relationships and just face rejection its hard to feel satisfied. I love my own company, i do, but i just csnt find any woman i want to be with who does.

i know people say get over the muscular thing but the truth si even when i tried i had no desire to be physical with the women i tried to date and i dont think it would be fair to have a relationship which is just friendship when they might want to be physical and i just wouldnt want them that way.

i feel so alone and lost. I feel my life isnt worth living. If my brother and sister were gone id take euthenasia tomorrow.

sorry i just needed to rant. I feel like i cant cope with life. And i know im going to die alone and no woman ever chose me as her favourite person. And all i ever wanted was that in life.

Like what are we trees now!?! I came to stretch not to be lectured about my “energy flow” by someone who charges $65 a class. Like gtfo. Burns my wallet too.

How do I stop hating myself?,"I am in my thirties, female. I spend a large majority of my time thinking about how embarrassing and unliked I am. I used to be very social, and drank a lot in social situations that would lead to horrible hangovers and self loathing. I don’t drink often anymore rarely at all but I still feel the hatred and guilt constantly. 

I have been in some stage of depression and anxiety since 14. I’ve tried antidepressants with no improvement. I was on anti anxiety meds for 2 years but came off when pregnant and never went back due to the chokehold they had on me. Great numb feeling, terrible withdrawal though and I am aware that rationally taking Xanax, even prescribed, is actually not doing me any favors long term. 

I am a SAHM and adore my children. I spend the majority of my time at home. Every single time I am in a social situation with others my age (mostly my husband’s friends/wives), I enjoy myself but the following day am wrecked. I rethink every single thing I said and feel stupid. It’s a constant thought. “Omg why did you talk so much that’s why they rarely come over” “why would you make a joke like that they probably talked about you on the way home” etc, etc. 
I absolutely hate myself and I do genuinely think most people find me insignificant and unlikeable. I feel shame as if I’ve committed some horrible crime.
How do I stop caring about what others think of me? How can I ever be happy? 

Self hatred is an awful, awful mental burden.

I am a SAHM and adore my children. I spend the majority of my time at home. Every single time I am in a social situation with others my age (mostly my husband’s friends/wives), I enjoy myself but the following day am wrecked. I rethink every single thing I said and feel stupid. It’s a constant thought. “Omg why did you talk so much that’s why they rarely come over” “why would you make a joke like that they probably talked about you on the way home” etc, etc. 
I absolutely hate myself and I do genuinely think most people find me insignificant and unlikeable. I feel shame as if I’ve committed some horrible crime.
How do I stop caring about what others think of me? How can I ever be happy?

Just want to disappear abroad and start over,"I'm 35M. Divorced, no kids, left my religious community same time as my divorce and am now shunned, so no friends or family. The only time my family reaches out is to tell me to come back to the religion (JW).

I work from home, call center, and just hate my job. I hate being yelled at all day, pressured to follow strict metrics, getting negative reviews that are about the company and not me, but it brings my scores down.

I just want to disappear. I want to just travel Europe, go to Thailand, or Japan. And just leave everything behind. Leave my job. Leave my apartment. Get rid of all my stuff. And just escape.

I know it won't 'fix me'. I know it won't solve my problems. I'll be alone and tired and anxious and depressed with no self esteem anywhere I go. But I just can't take my life anymore. If I've already lost everything what's the point of trying to live a 'normal' life, work a 9-5, buy a house, get a mortgage, etc. I tried dating, I had a beautiful, sweet, kind, warm, loving girlfriend. Someone who really cared about me. We were together for about a year. But my anxiety and depression won out. I let her go. I couldn't handle it, having someone rely on me, imagining a future together. I just couldn't. So I ended her relationship. Broke her heart. I just disappoint and hurt everyone I know. 

I think about just ending my life every day. But part of me still wants to explore and see the world. It's the only bit of hope I have.

So i want to just disappear. Let everything go. I'm finally close to paying off the remainder of my debt and that's it. Maybe I'm just nervous and depressed about going back to work this week. So I'll just sit here and play video games to forget about my life. 

I hate my life. And just want the sadness and emptiness to be over.

A Story I’ve Held Inside for Too Long.,"(Trigger Warning: Emotional Abuse / Internalized Homophobia / Depression / 
Dark Thoughts)

This is a lot to read, so fair warning. I’m not writing this for attention or sympathy. I just need to share my story, because I’ve been holding it inside for too long, and it’s been quietly destroying me.

My entire life, I’ve questioned my sexuality. I grew up being taught that liking boys was wrong, a sin that would be punished. My friends would make jokes about it constantly, and I’d sit there silently, laughing along to fit in, even though every word cut me deeply. Nobody knew I was gay. I buried that part of myself so deeply that even I began to forget who I was.

I dated girls. I forced myself to be someone I wasn’t, hoping that pretending hard enough would make it true. It never worked. The internal pressure eventually became too much. I dropped out of school from stress and anxiety that, deep down, I know came from repressing who I truly am. That spiraled into depression, and before I realized it, years passed by in a blur of numbness and pain. I missed so much.

Eventually, I met a group of friends, and for the first time in forever, I felt a little happiness. We grew close, did everything together. And within this group, there was a boy. I’ll call him Ky.

Ky and I got really close. We’d joke, argue playfully, and spend time together outside the group. Movies, food, exchanging gifts, talking all the time. One night, I drove him home and we held hands for a bit. It was small, but it meant the world to me. For the first time since I was a kid, I felt hope. I felt alive. Loved, even. We’d even joke about relationships and kissing sometimes, it made me believe, maybe, just maybe, he felt something too.

This went on for a couple of months. I was building up the courage to tell him how I felt. He would’ve been the first boy I ever opened up to like that.

But then… everything changed.

One night, we were all in a party chat playing Xbox, and some of the guys started making homophobic jokes, stuff I won’t even repeat. I stayed silent. I was used to it. But then one of the friends made a joke aimed at me and Ky, something like:
“You two spend so much time together, you dating behind our backs or something? Gay boys.”

Everyone laughed.

Except me.

Then Ky said something I’ll never forget for the rest of my life.

“I’d rather see him suicidal than ever be gay with him.”

And just like that… every tiny bit of happiness, hope, and healing I’d built crumbled in a second. I left the party. I cried for hours. And after that night, nothing was the same.

He never apologized. He never brought it up. To this day, over a year later, i’m 24 now and we’re all still in that same friend group, and he still shows up in Xbox parties like nothing ever happened. Like we never happened. Like that moment never meant a thing.

And maybe it didn’t. Maybe I never meant anything to him. I don’t know why I keep talking to him. I don’t know why I still hope for something that was never real. But I do.

I’ve stopped going outside. I’ve lost motivation to do anything. My friends sometimes ask why I’m always so down, but I just say I’m going through something, and then they move on. I’m the quiet one now. The broken one.

I miss him.
And I hate that I miss him.

I don’t understand how someone I loved,  someone who felt like my first real connection, could say something so cruel and then live like it never happened. Like I don’t matter. I guess I don’t.

There were days I wanted to end everything. I slept through weeks. I barely ate. I didn’t leave my room. I became a shell of the person I once was, the person I could’ve been if the world had just let me be myself.

I’m trying now. I’ve made a call to a therapist. I’ve been going out a little more. I’m trying to heal. But the truth is, I don’t even know if you can heal from something like this. When someone shatters a part of you that was already fragile, the part you’ve been protecting your whole life, it doesn’t just bounce back. It stays cracked. It stays sore.

I’m not looking for attention. I just needed to let this out.
I don’t want to keep holding it in anymore. It’s eating me alive.

All I can hope for now is that someday… somehow… I’ll feel whole again.
That I’ll find peace.
That someone will love me for me, all of me.
And that maybe, someone reading this will feel a little less alone knowing they’re not the only one who’s been through it.

"I think I'm depressed or falling into it, it's not typical in my culture so I don't know if I'm just being weak","I come from a culture where we're used to just getting on with things and we see depression and things like that as just soft. Recently I moved to a new city because I was really really on the verge of destruction in my old one; having fist fights with siblings, losing my mind quite often and just spending years in a single room feeling life was over and I don't know why I'm here. 

I wanted to break out of that cycle of just breaking down almost every day and coping with weed and alcohol that I moved to a new city. Now being in this new city for a few months, I feel low in spirit. I have 1 friend here who I used to date, but I decided to keep us as friends because I didn't want to have a breakup go bad and lose her. Besides her I'm alone here, it's a lovely city with kind people but I can't seem to get a break with dating, making new friends and I've fallen back into the smoking and drinking and misery. 

I didn't think anything was wrong with me until I lost my mind at my former boss cancelling my week-long shift at a music festival, this coupled with the fact my new job reduced my schedule to 3 days a week just made the reality that I'm in a lot of debt and needed that money very clear. This week has been particularly hard for me, seeing all my friends I'd planned to spend time with at the festival happy while I'm sat home just beating myself up. Like now every day I wake up so down, I try to keep up gym and stretches and walks to keep me up and it helps but I just feel there's no point to things anymore. A week ago a close family friend got sick and had surgery, another friend is depressed and another tried to take his life so I don't even feel I can speak to any of them as they're in their own situations,  this and a few other little bad moments just make me want to quit life now and get it over with. I did spend the weekend with my nephews and my mum so it lifted me and I'm grateful. Problem is I'm usually the strong friend with jokes and positive outlook so I struggle to open up to others but man I feel like I've lost all my friends from growing up and now just feel isolated here but I can't move back home I'm too old for that

I think I've just managed to ruin the only good thing I've ever let myself have,"I think I've just ruined probably my only relationship I'll ever have. I'm in uni preparing for an exam tomorrow and went to pick up a food delivery for me and my girlfriend when I got back in she was looking through the youtube history and found some videos talking about discovering if your trans and how to live with it. ( I'm not trans but I did think I may have been up until about a week ago ) we already talked about this issue I had and agreed that we both don't think I am trans to which she was thankful because she doesn't think that she will still be attracted to me and wish to stay if I was, which I respect. We both cried for about an hour before being able to move on but finding the old videos in the history makes her think that I lied and that I'm hiding somthing from her and that she doesn't trust me to not hide anything from her anymore.

I tried to explain but she didn't believe me at all and I can't stand the thought of losing her, she's the only good thing I have and is the only reason I haven't ended everything already and am still on my course but I'm afraid I'm going to lose that reason soon as she walked away and won't speak to me.

"Lost My Girl For Good, Moving to the Next Life","Recently was broken up with for what feels like the last time, for real this time. She just all the sudden seemed to hate and be disgusted with me when she hadn’t had that disposition prior. I  def take responsibility for my faults in our relationship but we were working on both of ours and starting to open up. I don’t know what the fuck is wrong with me, and I’m tired of letting people I love and care for down in every way. I’m gonna miss the way she smiled at me while I was singing on road trips, I’m going to miss her nose with the perfect curves and ring also the little creases where her nose meets her cheeks…. I’ll miss our love for music and cooking, and doing both while dancing around the kitchen, I’m gonna miss our wknd outings perusing through local markets, I’m going to miss our musical journeys together, I’ll miss the way we talked shit about other ppl silently together, I’ll miss the way she gets excited about little things and the way she was opening up to me slowly even though it terrified her, I’ll miss the way we locked eyes for hours whether on the couch, at dinner or during sex, it was an electric connection I didn’t know existed before her. I’ll miss our doggy days on trails and breweries. I’m going to miss her dog who loved me like I was her dad, and I’ll miss my pup too 😔 I hope he lands somewhere he enjoys. I hope she doesn’t truly believe that I don’t love her and don’t care for her like she said before she cut me off. All I wanted was to say a proper goodbye and I didn’t get that chance, I just don’t want her to think that of me when I’m gone. I want her to know it’s not her fault or because of her, I only realized that if I couldn’t be better for her, the only thing I have ever loved….. it isn’t going to happen.  I finally tried the only hobby of mine that gives me mental clarity today after a couple years off, and it didn’t give me the relief I was hoping for, I’m done trying. I love her so much and I fucking miss her. I hope in the next life I will see her and not be such a lousy partner. I’ve got a few things to wrap up and then tomorrow night is the night.

I wish someone understood,"I feel like I will sound like a broken record writing this but I would really appreciate some uplifting words or encouragement. I have alot to be grateful for in my life right now, I have my health, a roof over my head, a job, and someone I love. But I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since I was a child. My depression has really subsided since I moved away from home to go to college. I never felt so normal. Not even like joy but just normalcy and not feeling like I need to survive everyday. If there’s anything you should understand from reading this, it’s that my family hasn’t been the best to me emotionally. My parents get mad at me when I admit that I am feeling down. I remember growing up and being yelled at for crying. So now I don’t really cry a lot it’s hard to for some reason but sometimes I wish I could just cry when im overwhelmed. Ever since I’ve been back home for the summer away from college I feel like im getting bad again. Being with my family is like being in the loudest silence ever and it feels like one wrong move and everything will explode. I’ve been working so much since summer started and my job is the one thing that both is overwhelming me but also keeping me afloat. I work so I can afford school because I want to go to graduate school and I want to study abroad if I save enough money. I’ve been taking on triple doubles every week. It’s been so overwhelming but I actually rather be at work than home. Today, I was really sad and just felt alone. I left my house and showered for the first time in a couple days. I was wanting to do something by myself and for myself on my one day off. But everything just went wrong. It was storming outside, the store I wanted to go to was closed, my car ran out of gas. I know all of this is small things but it was enough for me to cry on the drive home alone because I just wanted a day for myself. I gave up and showered and crawled into bed. I just want to be alone but I also just want someone to understand. I told my mom I was sad because I want comfort so bad. It’s weird wanting comfort from someone you also fear. I just want my mom for a few minutes. She seemed upset that I was sad. I said I don’t know why I was feeling like this today. She hasn’t talked to me for the rest of the day.

Being poor makes me depressed.,"I hate being poor. I currently live off of my SSDI checks, since I can't work due to my autism, my digestive disorders, and my chronic back pain.

i feel worthless…,"so basically one of my friends, let's call her M, is upset with me. 

a little background... it was almost the day of prom and i hear the worst news: my other friend, let's call her Emily, announced that she's going to prom with THE GUY I LIKE. when i heard this, i felt all kinds of things:
anger. sadness. betrayal. hurt. everything attacking me at once.

now, i mean to be fair, she didn't know i liked him when she announced that, but one of my friends, let's call her Annie, told me she tried telling her that but didn't know if i still liked him since I was with this other guy for 2 days and my friends thought i was over him. 

when i tried telling Emily and my friend group, how i felt about the situation. it felt as if everyone was siding with Emily and asking me ""are you saying she CANT go with him?""

like i mean its girl code butttt anyways...

so after this all went down, a bunch of people associated me with the drama and wanted space from me.

it hurts because Emily seems so sweet, inclusive, fun, outgoing, and perfect. i guess part of me envies her. 

but anyways after some time most of my friends got over it and i did too and i thought things were back to normal....

until my friend M. 

okay so i have this feeling one day that M is avoiding me and is acting weird so i text her and ask ""hey is everything okay? i noticed you've been not acting like yourself""

and she had the audacity to say ""i need a break"" 

and i say audacity because i avoided the group for a bit after the drama because they crossed my boundaries. but M didn't respect that because she got mad at me instead. 

she said she was hurt because i was avoiding them and i said mean things about them. i apologized multiple times and we even CALLED and what did she say? well she said ""im SO grateful you called me! i understand you a lot better!""

and continues to ask for space.

i want to leave my friend group but i go to a small school and i would end up alone if i left.

also i feel like shit. i messed up everything and it's my fault. i'm severely depressed and have hit rock bottom, and that only makes people want to leave me. i want to die. i'm weak. i hate myself. but i feel so alone.

I am seeing a rapid mental health therapist for severe depression and suicidal ideation. I was not cooperative in the last couple of sessions and they said they give me space until I feel ready. I declined to answer assessment questions in my sessions and asked them to be patient with me.

If I don’t die, and I ended up seeing my therapist again, I won’t tell them what I did but if they find out, I am scared of their reaction. Will they be mad if they find out I am dead?

"Spent 20 minutes crying while repeating the words, ""I am an idiot"" over and over","Recently cried while on the bed, phone aside, stuck in my thoughts. 

I'm an introvert, and I don't have any friends. Life's been feeling so pointless and meaningless, I sometimes have the urge to cut my palm but fear my family members will see it and start worrying about me. 

I just hate myself, I've been feeling so broken inside. Left with these thoughts for too long. I've been bed rotting, aimlessly scrolling through yt shorts and sleeping unhealthy because I have nothing to do this summer. It's been the worst time of my life. 

I've been feeling so anxious, and fearful of being alone in this world as an introvert. I have no one to love or get in a relationship, I don't feel attractive or interesting to anyone, I'm just that outcast you see at school that everyone ignores. 

I'm just stupid, I don't have that knowledge everyone has in common as a 17 year old. I'm just gonna spiral into severe depression and eventually end my life because I don't want to suffer the consequences of not preparing for adult responsibilities. I want to improve, but my laziness has been pulling me back. My mental health is declining and I can't save myself. 

I've never felt this depressed to the point where I am crying because of how useless I am. That I'm never gonna find love or any friends, I'm just pathetic at life. 

I'm an uneventful guy with a declining mental health that I can't seem to save myself. It's becoming pointless. 

I won't end it, I know loved ones will grieve for me, even if it's a small number, it'll hurt them more than it'll hurt me. 

There's one thing that I don't understand, why do I like the feeling of it?

I am broken,"I don’t enjoy life anymore. There’s no reason for me to try continuing to fix myself when I’m so far gone that it’s just a Sisyphus battle. 

I’ve realized I’m incredibly difficult to love. Besides the fact that I’ve never had a girlfriend, the girls I end up going on dates with or talking to always ends badly for me. I was texting back and forth with someone who I found very cool. I let my hopes get up and I got excited. But she then ghosted me, no explanation why. Stuff like this consistently happen. I’m the only common denominator 

Another thing is I don’t really have a plan because I messed up my life so badly. I’m in college right now. I’m a premed. My gpa is 2.6. I’m not good enough for medical school. The work experience I have within the medical field is all gotten because of family connections, not because of my own merit. I’m just too dumb. 

On top of that, my own family doesn’t believe in me. No one believes I can become a doctor. I wanted to become a psychiatrist because I believed in helping others with their problems, but I can’t even help myself. My parents are pushing a us career institute medical assistant course. Originally, I thought they still had some hope I could get into medicine. 

They accidentally let it slip that it’s because they don’t think I’ll ever get into medical school, or even PA school. They don’t believe in me. And I don’t blame them. But the course is entirely there just because they want me to have some career after college. 

I don’t believe in myself either. I mean, how could I? I didn’t have abusive parents. They’re still together. My younger brother is doing more than well with his life. And he wasn’t raised differently from me. It’s my fault that I put myself into this situation. I had the ability to pursue being a doctor, working in mental health. I had the privilege of a great upbringing. I wasn’t in any position to ever do any “bad” things. And my parents do love me deeply. 

And yet, despite that, I still ended up broken. While many people would kill for my life, I wasn’t good enough to actually make use of it. I have no excuses. I just am like this. It doesn’t matter how much I study. How many people I talk to. How much effort I put into myself. It’s been for naught. 

I’ve been broken since high school. Despite hours of therapy, medications, doing things out of my comfort zone, and just trying like a motherfucker, I’m still at 0. I’ll always be a 0. 

At this point, I don’t see a foreseeable future where I’m content with my life. 

I’ve tried to love myself. I’d force myself to just do the things I want to do. Need to do. From basic hygiene to the gym to socializing to studying.

I told them my plan,"TW: Suicidal Ideation


I told my psychiatrist and my therapist this week that I’m basically just waiting for my 16 year-old cat to pass on before I kill myself.

Neither seems to think I need to go back to the hospital at this point. (I was hospitalized for 13 days back in September.) I don’t know, I felt like they should have had a stronger reaction? My therapist even said that my psychiatrist mentioned I was “doing a little better.”

Gaining weight on meds?,"I'm not sure if my meds are making me gain weight/increasing my appetite. I usually blame myself with no excuse. I know that my weight gain is related to what I've been eating. I've also been dieting and exercising (not for long, 3 weeks only) but the scale didn't budge AT ALL. If I diet and exercise heavily (1,100 kcal a day + exercise) then the scale doesn't budge. If I eat normally (1,500 kcal a day) I gain weight. If I let go for a few days I gain double the weight??? I would say I'm currently gaining weight at a rate of 2 kilos a week. It's very concerning. 

There used to be a time in my life where I didn't eat anything for days. That's when I was extremely depressed and off meds. Now all I think about is food. I can't stop eating. 

I usually take prozac and topamax. The psychiatrist specifically prescribed them to prevent weight gain and increased appetite. That's why I feel very stupid to say that I feel like my appetite is increased when I'm on them. However I've also been introduced to antipsychotics and anxiety meds 3 months ago. Ever since then I've gained 15 kilos 🙃. 

As I said. I do blame myslef and take full responsibility for my weight gain. On the other hand I would like to consider the possibility that maybe the meds are causing weight gain because 2 kilos a week is just...??? Very scary and concerning. Not to mention my body dysmorphea. Does anyone else have a similar experience?

Depressed in-law crossing my boundaries,"My 40 year old in law comes over unannounced whenever he feels like it. He suffers from depression, loneliness, anxiety. He lets himself into my backyard or invites himself into the house. And then sits for hours unloading problems into me. I try to help and give advice but he will argue why nothing can be done and then continue to complain about the same thing over and over again.

It’s absolutely exhausting and I’m this close to telling him to fuck off and not come around ever again.

But I worry he might harm himself. So I’m always kind. I’ve tried calling nurse hotline. But everyone says an adult can’t get help unless they ask for it. So while he needs a psychiatrist and many other things he doesn’t get one and just puts all his problems on me.

I am so angry lately I am beginning to hate him. I’ve decided I won’t speak to him about anything except for the weather. And if my partner isn’t here I’ll say sorry I’m busy you have to go. Call your brother.

Personally I think this man is extremely selfish. He never fucking thinks about my mental health or what I want. I too have depression and anxiety that I mange through treatment. And I am an extreme introvert. I have very little need for socializing it is exhausting.

Un cumpleaños más,"¿Han experimentado el pensamiento constante, durante años, de no querer luchar más?
Pues a mí me pasa todos los días. Trato de ver el lado bueno de la vida, alegrarme con cada cosa, estar en mi presente y guardar cada momento en el corazón.
A veces pienso que la felicidad no existe, que la vida nos da toda la felicidad en la primera etapa, y con el tiempo, el aprendizaje y las vivencias, vamos dejando esa felicidad de lado: la muerte de seres queridos, el daño inconsciente y consciente a otros, rupturas amorosas, problemas del diario vivir... Y al final, ¿por qué trabajamos? ¿Por qué seguimos?
¿Para qué?
Hoy es mi cumpleaños, y desde que tengo 4 o tal vez 5 años he hecho la oración, mínimamente una vez cada tres meses, de que quiero morir. No quiero seguir; quiero dejar de preocuparme por las responsabilidades de otros. Quiero dejar de pensar si mis padres están comiendo bien. Quiero poder irme tranquilo y no pensar si mi padre le pegó o no a mi madre, si la sigue gritando o si al menos mejoró.

Pues a mí me pasa todos los días. Trato de ver el lado bueno de la vida, alegrarme con cada cosa, estar en mi presente y guardar cada momento en el corazón.
A veces pienso que la felicidad no existe, que la vida nos da toda la felicidad en la primera etapa, y con el tiempo, el aprendizaje y las vivencias, vamos dejando esa felicidad de lado: la muerte de seres queridos, el daño inconsciente y consciente a otros, rupturas amorosas, problemas del diario vivir... Y al final, ¿por qué trabajamos? ¿Por qué seguimos?
¿Para qué?
Hoy es mi cumpleaños, y desde que tengo 4 o tal vez 5 años he hecho la oración, mínimamente una vez cada tres meses, de que quiero morir. No quiero seguir; quiero dejar de preocuparme por las responsabilidades de otros. Quiero dejar de pensar si mis padres están comiendo bien. Quiero poder irme tranquilo y no pensar si mi padre le pegó o no a mi madre, si la sigue gritando o si al menos mejoró.

Gettin' better all the time,"Inside me, there is this person that doesn't care, doesn't want things, doesn't have what he doesn't need, and doesn't take any interest in the world. Left to his own devices, he'd have me in bed all day, getting high and watching TV, and not doing anything with my life. Nobody likes this person. Nobody wants this person. This person is horribly lonely all the time.

Each and every day, that's the person I have to overcome if I want to actually use the precious time I have on this earth. I have to replace this awful person with someone else, something reasonably sustainable for me to maintain, and even with that, I'm still disappointed with what I'm left with. I'm just a fraction of what I could be. Pieces of me are all I have to give.

How can I love myself if love is the source of all my pain and suffering? I'm under enough pressure just being alone; I don't want to become somebody else's problem just because they were unfortunate enough to love me.

"Suicidal but only ""mild"" depression","A few months ago, I had a phase that lasted only a couple of days – maybe three or four – where I had really intense suicidal thoughts. It felt like they were constantly in my head. I thought about it all the time and even started researching methods. Back then, I felt like lying in front of a train would be the most certain option, but when I saw that a third of people survive that with severe injuries, it scared me. I didn’t want to survive it and live with the consequences – I just wanted it to stop.

What’s strange is that now I don’t have these kinds of thoughts anymore – not actively. I sometimes think about it, but I know I wouldn’t actually do anything. And weirdly, that almost feels harder. Back then, the thought of ""if it doesn’t get better, I’ll end it"" gave me a kind of relief, like a way out. Now I just feel stuck. Things aren’t better, but I also know I won’t act on those thoughts, so it feels like I have no option but to keep going. And that’s incredibly hard.

At the same time, my therapist diagnosed me with only a mild depression, which makes me question everything. Like – could I even have had such thoughts if it was “only” a mild depression? Did I maybe exaggerate it in my memory? I don’t know.

Has anyone else experienced something like this – a short but really intense suicidal phase, even though your diagnosis (if you have one) wasn’t that “severe”? I’d really appreciate hearing if others have felt this too.

I don’t know what the point of this is but yeah (28),"My therapist has recommended this, she knows I use Reddit and after confessing to her that I don’t have anyone to talk to in my day to day, she said I should make a post about how I’m feeling, just to get it out. So here goes.

I feel like I can’t carry on anymore. I’ve been fighting this disease for as long as I can remember, I’ve been put on countless medications all of which have had more side effects than actual uses.

I work with kids and I know that my sudden disappearance would have a negative effect on them and honestly at this point that’s the only thing keeping me here. Nobody else would even notice, but they would. 

I’m not looking for sympathy, I’m not looking for a fix or someone to tell me that everything will be okay because everything isn’t okay, it never really has been and probably never will be.

I’m not looking for sympathy, I’m not looking for a fix or someone to tell me that everything will be okay because everything isn’t okay, it never really has been and probably never will be.

This is a cry for help (tw mention: sa),"Hey, My name is May I'm F17. 

I have been clinically diagnosed with ADHD and PTSD, I have been feeling so depressed and I want to end my life the week after my situationships birthday which is around July.

I have been SA'ed my entire childhood and teen years currently basically my whole life as I would say it.

I was SA'ed for 3 years (8 - 10 years old)by an relative and It left me with PTSD and I became depressed and hypersexual at an young age.
I promised myself this would never happen to me again but it happened again with an ex of mine who's SA'ed me for 3 years of our relationship, He emotionally, physically, narcissistically and sexually abused me in many ways which damaged and doubled my SA trauma and while he was SAing during these times I was SA'ed by an unknown man in an parking lot.

While I was being SA'ed by the relative, I was online chronically on Amino and I had an online boyfriend who was an year older than me and he would sex roleplay with me all the time and It made me more hypersexual so I thought that giving my body to someone was normal as a child thinking it was a way of love and attention but I knew it felt gross and werid.

I feel very depressed and I wanna die I can't stop crying all I could feel is them touching me and hurting me and I just can't get rid of the bad memories.

I have a loving family, loving friends and I met someone whos such an darling and treats me like an actual princess but I can't handle any of this pain anymore because I don't think I'm strong enough anymore, I can't escape from something that isn't there to hurt me anymore because Its in my mind everyday dissociating me.

I'm going to be a Senior but I don't think I'll ever make it to graduation, I just don't wanna suffer from all this pain and trauma anymore I'm not strong anymore I can't keep carrying it around me and act like nothing happened the most traumatizing thing thats ever happened just there happened in the past.

I have always felt like my body was more loved more than my heart was ever loved.

I don't wanna be in this body anymore, I want to get rid of this filthy touched body.

"Just a friendly reminder to everyone out there, go get a blood test!","Almost a year and a half since my first panic attack and it has definitely been a journey, have had my ups and downs, but a lot more downs than I’d like

Being the hypochondriac that I am, I felt that there was something wrong with me(tired, fatigue, brain fog), like 100%, but also I was like I’m just anxious and I’m in that cycle

Got a full blood test and guess what, VIT D was at 21(recommended: 30-100); takes me back to my first panic attack when I was in Manchester, and I was holed up in my room for a whole ass month without going outside(literally no exposure to sunlight)

Did not believe that my vitamin deficiency could lead to any of the symptoms I had been feeling more acutely since the past couple of months

Started supplementation and guess what, 12 days later, I’ve started feeling slightly better, I’m a lot more of control in my thoughts, do not have brain fog, no dizzy spells, I’m sleeping like a baby

Do I still get anxious? Sure, Is it scary? Eh not as much, Do I get over it quickly? Fuck yes

I understand that this might just be me and a handful of people but a lot of times, there might be certain factors which are malleable and one of them is your health

I Almost Quit My Job in Silence But Then My Coworker Said One Sentence That Stopped Me,"Hi everyone,

I haven’t really talked about this before, but last week I reached a breaking point. I’ve been juggling way too much for too long work deadlines, family pressure, personal stuff. I’d been pretending I was okay, smiling through meetings, replying “All good” when it wasn’t.

But inside, I was completely drained. No energy. No peace. Just survival mode on repeat.

That day, I stayed back late again. I opened a Word doc to type my resignation  not because I had a plan, but because I just couldn’t keep faking it anymore.

Then a coworker  someone I barely talk to  came by to grab their things. She paused, looked at me, and quietly said:
“Hey… you don’t always have to be the strong one.”

And for some reason, that broke me.

Not in a bad way  it was the first time in a long time someone saw me without me having to explain or prove anything.

We ended up talking for half an hour. She shared her own experience with burnout. No judgment, no pressure. Just honesty. And for the first time in weeks, I didn’t feel alone.

I still haven’t made a final decision about work. But I’m taking some time to rest. And I just want to say
If you’re overwhelmed, you’re not weak. You’re human.
You don’t always have to carry it alone.

Sometimes one honest moment can keep someone from walking away silently.

but inside i was completely drained no energy no peace just survival mode on repeat

that day i stayed back late again i opened a word doc to type my resignation  not because i had a plan but because i just couldnt keep faking it anymore

then a coworker  someone i barely talk to  came by to grab their things she paused looked at me and quietly said
hey you dont always have to be the strong one

and for some reason that broke me

not in a bad way  it was the first time in a long time someone saw me without me having to explain or prove anything

we ended up talking for half an hour she shared her own experience with burnout no judgment no pressure just honesty and for the first time in weeks i didnt feel alone

i still havent made a final decision about work but im taking some time to rest and i just want to say
if youre overwhelmed youre not weak youre human
you dont always have to carry it alone

sometimes one honest moment can keep someone from walking away silently

Stomach is burning up from anxiety,"So I get cyclical vomiting. Whenever I get super anxious, I'll throw up constantly for a few days and my stomach gets a really annoying burning sensation. Does anyone else get this? Any ideas to reduce the burn?

"Anxiety is ruining my life, i'm lost","( srry if my eng isnt that good ) 
Like many of you, anxiety never leaves me. I live in constant fear and anxiety. I hardly ever leave my house ( i work in freelance ). My anxiety has reached such a point that, for many years now, it has caused me a variety of severe physical pains. For 2 years I've had medical examinations due to hormonal pain which were flawed because of my anxiety symptoms (I was diagnosed with endometriosis at the end). These medical appointments didn't go so well and they left me even more mentally exhausted. Now I often have anxiety attacks and phobias that I didn't have before. I've been to many psychologists in my life, but they've never really helped me. For 3 years I was on anti-anxiety medication but it was a disaster.

 It was as if the further I got into my life, the less I saw the end of it. I can't find any concrete solutions. I feel as if my anxieties are never going to leave me but are always going to grow. Sometimes I'm so tired that I think about dying (I don't want to, but I'm fed up with myself). I'm lucky to have my family and my boyfriend who are there for me and try to help me. But I just can't.

How do you handle the constant *what if”*thoughts without spiraling?,"Hi everyone,

I’ve been struggling lately with nonstop “what if” thoughts , like, \*What if I embarrass myself?\* \*What if I mess up at work?\* \*What if something bad happens to my family?\*

I know logically that worrying doesn’t change anything, but it feels like my brain just grabs onto worst case scenarios and won’t let go.

I’m working with a therapist (so I’m not looking for medical advice), but I’d really appreciate hearing how others here cope in the moment when the thoughts are overwhelming.

"I’ve been going through derealization where it feels like I’m in a different environment, even though I know the place very well","
So lately I’ve been experiencing what I think is derealization. It only happens in my room, usually when I sit down to study. I suddenly feel like I’m in a different version of my room — like everything is the same, but it doesn’t feel familiar anymore. Almost like I’m seeing it for the first time, even though I’ve been there thousands of times.

It’s not like I’m blacking out or unaware — I know I’m in my room and what I’m doing, but the vibe or feel of the place shifts, like I’m in an alternate layer of reality.

It was uncomfortable, so I started doing a few small things to help pull myself back:

I play music — it helps bring some normalcy and anchors my mind.

I describe the room out loud or in my head: “This is my desk, the wall is this color, my book is here.”

I added a small change to my environment — like spraying a nice perfume or changing lighting. That “newness” helps snap me back.

And honestly, just believing in myself and reminding myself that I’m safe and it’s temporary has helped a lot.


If anyone else feels this way, you’re not alone. These little grounding tricks made a big difference for me.

In need of support,"this may be a possible tw? not too sure but thought id put it out there first before saying anything !

hi there, 
for the past 2 weeks i’ve had this horrific feeling of dread that i’m going to die by sunday. never in my life have i felt this genuine fear and certainty before, although i do really struggle with anxiety and i have struggled with it all my life. i’ll often think thoughts of death but will always think past in thinking ‘it’ll never happen im fine’. but these past 2 weeks have been really difficult and hard. i have this feeling that im going to actually die and that i can’t do anything to stop it. i want it to stop but i cant seek help anywhere. ive tried to blame it on things but for some reason i can’t pinpoint what the cause is. 

the worst part of the feeling is thinking of this time next week and onwards. i keep thinking i wont be here to even experience it. like, my friend or family will say something about the winter or something and in my head i’ll think ‘i wont even be here to experience it’. 
its genuinely the worst feeling i think i’ve ever experienced and i desperately want some help to comfort myself. 


i’m going on a short trip abroad (from london to greece) on Thursday, im going with my best mate and her parents - it’ll be the first time i have been on a flight for the first time in a year and abroad without a parent, since i barely choose to go on holidays. i felt really pressured to go since everything was paid for, all i had to buy was the tickets for my flight. this is what triggered the thoughts. i thought maybe the plane was going to have something to do with dying, or i wont be able to get home but then i deep it and think: ‘but why wouldn’t i be able to get home?’ and then i leave myself really confused.

does anyone know how i could change my mindset? any thoughts are really appreciated, thank u so so much!

Constant fear of being fired!,"I have had severe and crippling anxiety for as long as I can remember. With medications and therapy for other psychiatric issues, it has improved over the last few years. That being said, it is always in the back of my mind.

Thinking of IOP,"Hi!

I (25F) have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember, and was officially diagnosed when I was in elementary school. I didn’t speak to anyone outside of my family or my teachers (with the exception of one friend) until I was 10 years old, and while my social anxiety has dissipated some, my existential anxiety has gone through the roof in the last few years. I struggle to maintain my personal relationships due to persistent paranoia, and my professional relationships are lacking due to the social anxiety and imposter syndrome I have yet to shake.

My boyfriend of 6 years is likely going to end our relationship because of my incessant worrying about the future and constant need for reassurance that he wants to be with me. My best friends have heard the same story for years, and though they have made it clear they will always be there for me, I am extremely concerned that they are fed up with the cycle I’m in and will soon step back from our friendship. I am hyper aware of the way my thought patterns and subsequent actions are impacting my relationships, and even after years of acknowledging my destructive habits, I have not found a way to prevent myself from continuing down this path.

I don’t identify as being insecure, but my actions say otherwise. Being alone is one of my biggest fears and I am so worried that’s where I’m headed. I am very willing to put in the work needed to better myself, I think I just haven’t found a good place to start.

With that being said, I’m curious if anyone has experience with IOP, and can share some insight into what it did or did not do for you. Also, how did you handle taking time off of work to attend IOP (if applicable)? I know some facilities offer evening programs, but the ones in my insurance network appear to take place during my business hours. If you are someone who has struggled with severe relationship (romantic or platonic) anxiety, what are some habits you picked up or adjustments you made to alleviate some of the burden the anxiety has brought onto you?

My biggest struggle is health anxiety.,"all started when I developed a deep fear of death at the age of 14. Nothing seems to convince me not to be scared, especially since this fear is tied to religion i got deep into it and it will never change. Whenever I feel something unusual, I turn to Google — it's like my best friend during these episodes. I google every symptom obsessively.
Because of all this, I wake up feeling genuinely sick every single day. The nausea hits me all day long, along with some really uncomfortable digestive issues. I constantly feel off balance, unless I stay lying in bed. My heart also beats irregularly — it feels strange and unpredictable almost every day.

Every day brings new sensations, new symptoms. I've booked countless medical appointments, but it's never enough to ease my mind.

⚫️I’ve convinced myself I’m going to faint whenever I feel dizzy or off-balance in public. 

⚫️I deal with chronic nausea and constantly fear that I’m going to throw up or die (vomiting is one of my biggest phobias)

⚫️Sometimes I’m convinced I’m choking because I feel like there’s mucus stuck in my throat. 

⚫️If I eat something  whatever, I panic and think I’ll have an allergic reaction and my throat will close up.

⚫️I also avoid taking any medications because I’m terrified of having side effects or a severe allergic reaction. The fear of something going wrong overwhelms me, so I’d rather deal with the symptoms than risk trying medicine.

⚫️I’ve convinced myself I’ve had heart attacks because of the skipped heartbeats, rapid heart rate, and a heavy pressure in my chest.


⚫️I was also convinced I might have a brain aneurysm whenever I experienced a sudden headache, or that I had a brain tumor.

⚫️ I constantly check my face in the mirror to make sure it’s not paralyzed, in case I’m having a stroke.




The hardest part is that I can't even afford therapy  I simply don't have the money. So I'm reaching out here, hoping someone can help me.




Right now, I feel like I’ll never heal from this.

Wellbutrin,"Hi all,

I was on Zoloft for 6ish years and it definitely helped my anxiety but killed my libido. I thought I had my anxiety under control so I decided to stop it. Ya- that was a mistake. 6 months later (current) I’ve had a really awful flare up and I’m suffering pretty badly from anxiety right now. 

My doctor recommended I try Wellbutrin to address the anxiety without having the negative sexual effects. It’s been less than 2 weeks (2 weeks tomorrow), and I’ve been really struggling- having to take Xanax daily to get through. I’ve been told it takes about 4 weeks for it to get better but I’m really worried (anxious about being anxious) that I’ll make it to 4 weeks (and that will be hard), it won’t work, then I’ll have to end up switching to Zoloft anyway and that’s like another month after that to feel the effects of Zoloft.

28 Weeks on Sertraline – Still No Stability. Looking for Guidance,"Hi everyone,

First-time poster here. I’m a 33-year-old male, and I’ve been on 75mg of sertraline (Zoloft) for 28 weeks now (almost 7 months). I started during a dark period — severe anxiety, DP/DR, intrusive thoughts, anhedonia — and was later diagnosed with C-PTSD.

Since then, I've had a few “okay” days, but they’re rare and short-lived. Around Month 4, I began to notice some improvement, and again at the start of June, but nothing has really stuck. My mood is still unstable — some days I feel jittery or overly wired, others bring on depression or anxiety seemingly out of nowhere.

Right now, I’m dealing with frequent mood swings, intrusive thoughts, and a lack of pleasure. I can’t tell if it’s the medication causing this emotional rollercoaster or just my brain trying to recover. I’ve never experienced this kind of cycling before starting the SSRI.

That said, there *have* been some positives — better sleep, a bit more energy, and I’m less reactive to my thoughts. But part of me wonders if that’s the med working… or just placebo. To tell you I could not function on December, in February I was back to work and social activities,. However,  I am oftenfeeling off when engaging.

Deep down, I feel my actual dose might not be the right fit — especially when I read stories of people who *know* when they’ve found their med.

So I’m left wondering since I will meet my psychiatrist in a couple of weeks / what do you think of these scenarios ?

* Should I increase the dose?
* Add something like Wellbutrin?
* Taper off?
* Or just give it more time?

  
Is there anyone who have a similar timeline / story ? 

Thanks so much for reading — any advice or shared experience means a lot. Thanks for taking care of others.

best regards,

H.

Right now, I’m dealing with frequent mood swings, intrusive thoughts, and a lack of pleasure. I can’t tell if it’s the medication causing this emotional rollercoaster or just my brain trying to recover. I’ve never experienced this kind of cycling before starting the SSRI.

That said, there *have* been some positives — better sleep, a bit more energy, and I’m less reactive to my thoughts. But part of me wonders if that’s the med working… or just placebo. To tell you I could not function on December, in February I was back to work and social activities,. However,  I am oftenfeeling off when engaging.

Deep down, I feel my actual dose might not be the right fit — especially when I read stories of people who *know* when they’ve found their med.

So I’m left wondering since I will meet my psychiatrist in a couple of weeks / what do you think of these scenarios ?

* Should I increase the dose?
* Add something like Wellbutrin?
* Taper off?
* Or just give it more time?

  
Is there anyone who have a similar timeline / story ? 

Thanks so much for reading — any advice or shared experience means a lot. Thanks for taking care of others.

Health based anxiety,"How do you overcome health-based anxiety? It’s draining me and I’m sick of constantly thinking I’m going to drop because of whatever thing my anxiety has decided to latch on to. 

Last year I (27f) fully convinced myself I was diabetic (I’m 100% not—not even prediabetic) and ate like a type 2 diabetic for MONTHS. I would get physically ill during that time if I ate anything remotely “bad” for a diabetic. 

Now, for the past few months, it’s been focused on my heart. I’m hyperaware of my heart beating and any palpitations it does or any random twinges of pain I might have. This week, I’ve starting noticing a weird vibration in my chest/back (which I’m 99% sure is a muscle spasm after working overnights suddenly and sleeping on an air mattress) and my anxiety is making that to be “you’re gonna die, you’re going to have a heart attack.” I’m so sick of living like this and being constantly scared I’m just going to drop one day. 

I had an EKG 6-ish months ago. Perfectly fine. I track my heart rate religiously. All within good ranges. It’s gotten to the point I’m scared to take my medications (ADHD) because of how, namely, Adderall impacts my heart rate and it being a stimulant.

I stopped Zoloft 2 months ago for my anxiety and have seem to have become depressed. What gives?,"I want to add some backstory that may or may not help for the long term of how my brain functions. It's a tad long so if you want to read please do otherwise **TL;DR** at the bottom. I had a ""plan"" for a majority of my life. Basically someone always telling me what to do and ideally when to do it. Milestones in life like going to school k-12, then college, then marriage and then kids. For me K-12 was just an obvious yeah your going to keep moving up. I mean yeah I *could* repeat another grade but that's unlikely. 



After High School I went to college and then well I look back and I think that's where things started albeit on a much smaller scale that was unnoticeable. I wasn't the brightest kid throughout my life, hell I had modified tests (I needed an extra 5 mins to truly understand the problem being asked that I need to solve where everyone else gets it right away its hard to explain), was always the kid that was picked on until high school and when I found out I wasn't getting into other 4 year colleges with friends I've known my entire life and even just others I've known it killed me. I went to community college and worked at the same time. It just kinda felt like a continuation of HS and after 2 years I got into a 4yr university. Well that was a bomb shell because I was still working 40hrs + 18 credit hours and then it forced my grades to nothing. After work and school I didn't want to study more I wanted to just decompress which clearly was my downfall. Well fast forward the end of my 5th year and I was failing a class that I needed in order to graduate. It was the second time I was taking it. I passed by the skin of my teeth, but leading up into that I developed anxiety. I didn't even know what that was until then. Honest never heard of it, never experienced it etc. I started having the physical symptoms, heavy chest like I couldn't breathe, to the feeling of drinking 1000 energy drinks and pacing back and forth where I eventually passed out after the adrenaline wore off. Post graduation, I was still living in the apartment as I had a job from an internship. Everyone else moved back home and I was all alone. It was horrible. Anxiety attacks left and right.



That summer I knew I was going to ask my then girlfriend to marry me as that was ""the plan"" as I told myself you can't ask until you graduate. Well after the proposal I moved back home or rather in with her and felt a tad more at ease, but my career was crap. I went to school with the mindset like everyone teaches you you'll get a good job after college and work your way up. I got 2 jobs that I was both fired from after only a month or two because I didn't meet their standards and no one wanted to teach me (I was literally the only person in IT at both places so room for growth was null). As you can imagine that was a blow to my self-esteem on-top of everything else I've been experiencing. By this point I finally started zoloft (25mg). I've never taken meds outside of something for the flu so it was a weird time for me. I was still having anxiety attacks, but they were a tad more in-line. Eventually I went up to 75mg (tbh I can't remember when) but I also had a job I enjoyed and worked at for a bit and eventually got hired at another place for the following 5 years. 



Sadly shit hit the fan right before COVID and found out for a majority of the time I was with my then wife she was cheating on me with multiple people for YEARS. As you can imagine my world fell apart and I tried therapy for us both and also for myself. 1 year in and I called it quits as she had no desire to be with me. I took the step to move home and continue therapy.

  
Since then I've been in therapy and I can safely say even with the few different therapist (due to insurance change or affordability nothing wrong with any of the therapists themselves) and friends and family have said I've come an extremely long way and have all agreed that I've moved on. Now the issue with that is I've moved on from her. Truthfully I have. What I seem to have not moved on from was structure. Remember I said someone like my parents always made a plan for me. Go to school, pack your lunch, do soccer on the weekends, (I would make plans to hand with friends as I got old enough dont worry) and just a general sense that the ""world"" would take care of me as long as I did what was required. Well clearly life had other plans as you can see so I started wondering wtf am I even doing with myself? and now we've arrived to the last 6 months or so.

  
**TL;DR - a majority of my life someone else created a structure for me that I blindly followed and when I got to the end shit hit the fan from job losses to my ex having multiple affairs.**



I've had a great job for the last 2 years or so as it was the first time I felt accepted into a place that actually gave a shit about its employees. The friendliness, the fun banter, the pay, the ability to pay for certifications etc. Well I was in such a good place earlier this year I decided to work with my doctor and my therapist and inform them I'd like to start coming off my meds. I believed they served their purpose (the anxiety) for that part of my life. I was on them for about 9 years. I didn't enjoy how they made me forget things long term wise and that's really the only side effect I've ever had with them. So for the next 3 months I did 75mg every other day for a month, and then drop down to 50mg the following month to finally 25mg. Everything went well. The first week or two after the final 25mg I got brain zaps and just felt ""off"", but the brain zaps did go away. Now though for the last month maybe 2 I've just felt tired, and disconnected at times. Not a full disassociation or where I can see myself in third person, just I'm a rock watching time go by. From what I've gathered for myself and my therapist and some friends and family, I'm depressed. I've started to wonder if zoloft caused this or was the zoloft just masking it since post college graduation. I say that time because it was the last ""structured"" goal I had. I've had others that I've completed since like get a new car on my own, my own home, have dogs, work on some personal tech stuff I enjoy, but now I just don't know whats wrong with me. Ideally I don't want to go back on meds as I also don't think enough time has passed yet to fully determine that, but it has made me wonder if Zoloft gave me depression and this will eventually go away or is this now permanent. I fucking hate this feeling. I'm tired a lot, I'm just bleh half the time and a lot of things I used to enjoy now I just do them like a zombie. Don't get me wrong, I do laugh and enjoy stuff still, but its more 80 depressed/20 every other feeling now. It does seem like I'm going through life now without a goal/purpose and thats whats causing this feeling of depression.

  
So my question is, has zoloft or any other SSRI once you've come off it and have been off it since for Anxiety made you feel this way? If it did what steps did you take to overcome it and feel like yourself again. I'm aware everyone is different, but I just like to hear from others that I'm not alone in this feeling and there is something that can be done to help with this. Thank you

really long panic attack??,"So I’m 18, and I’ve been under a crazy amount of stress lately. I’m diagnosed with pretty severe anxiety and take a couple medications for it. I have a history of panic attacks, but i’ve never had anything like this and i’m starting to become really paranoid if maybe it’s not a panic attack and something wrong because it’s been a day now. 

Yesterday I was out of state with family and really stressed out, but ultimately fine. Everything was good but I suddenly got a tight feeling in my upper chest around my neck and my face got kind of hot and tingly and my hands and tongue went numb. I couldn’t breathe and was taking deep breaths and got really scared because I couldn’t breathe. It went away for about ten minutes, we got back in the car to drive home, and it came back a lot worse. I started freaking out because I thought I couldn’t breathe and I was shaking like crazy and crying hyperventilating but eventually calmed down. The whole hour car ride was like this where I would get it under control by reminding myself there’s no reason I can’t breathe, and then it would randomly come back in waves with a pang of anxiety. I felt a lot better after an hour and even went out with friends and was completely fine the rest of the night and this morning. 
Now it’s lightly coming back where I keep getting a really bad feeling and struggle to breathe a little bit, taking deep breaths and reminding myself I can breathe and there’s no reason I can’t. I think I’m scared it’s going to happen again. I’m so exhausted to top it all off. 

All of these factors are symptoms of panic attacks I’ve had in the past, the numbness is particularly something I’ve discussed with my psychiatrist, I’ve just never had them so extreme—it’s making me worry that something medically could be wrong. I think this worry is also making it worse. It’s not an issue when i’m distracted, but the moment i’m not doing anything it comes back. I’m not sure what to do.

Has anyone else experienced this? It’s freaking me out a lot. I don’t know if it’s just because i’m scared of having another panic attack that severe, because i’m too conscious of my breathing, or if there’s something possibly genuinely wrong. My mom is no help because all she does is yell at me and punish me for my issues with anxiety. She doesn’t believe me at all lol


Also unsure if this is relevant—I don’t want to detail my current situation but I ran out of my main medication, wellbutrin, and they wouldn’t refill it unless I made an appointment and it’s always been difficult for me to get in. I’ve been so busy lately I haven’t been able to reschedule an appointment that will work for me so I slowly stopped taking it the past two weeks after I went from 150MG (in the past i took 350 but downsized with my psychiatrist bc it was giving me paranoia and minor hallucinations), then started taking my 75 MG, etc until I stopped taking it entirely. Not sure if this could be affecting anything—I’ve been completely fine though in terms of this otherwise and still take my other medicine.

I started freaking out because I thought I couldn’t breathe and I was shaking like crazy and crying hyperventilating but eventually calmed down. The whole hour car ride was like this where I would get it under control by reminding myself there’s no reason I can’t breathe, and then it would randomly come back in waves with a pang of anxiety. I felt a lot better after an hour and even went out with friends and was completely fine the rest of the night and this morning. 
Now it’s lightly coming back where I keep getting a really bad feeling and struggle to breathe a little bit, taking deep breaths and reminding myself I can breathe and there’s no reason I can’t. I think I’m scared it’s going to happen again. I’m so exhausted to top it all off. 

All of these factors are symptoms of panic attacks I’ve had in the past, the numbness is particularly something I’ve discussed with my psychiatrist, I’ve just never had them so extreme—it’s making me worry that something medically could be wrong. I think this worry is also making it worse. It’s not an issue when i’m distracted, but the moment i’m not doing anything it comes back. I’m not sure what to do.

Has anyone else experienced this? It’s freaking me out a lot. I don’t know if it’s just because i’m scared of having another panic attack that severe, because i’m too conscious of my breathing, or if there’s something possibly genuinely wrong. My mom is no help because all she does is yell at me and punish me for my issues with anxiety. She doesn’t believe me at all lol


Also unsure if this is relevant—I don’t want to detail my current situation but I ran out of my main medication, wellbutrin, and they wouldn’t refill it unless I made an appointment and it’s always been difficult for me to get in. I’ve been so busy lately I haven’t been able to reschedule an appointment that will work for me so I slowly stopped taking it the past two weeks after I went from 150MG (in the past i took 350 but downsized with my psychiatrist bc it was giving me paranoia and minor hallucinations), then started taking my 75 MG, etc until I stopped taking it entirely. Not sure if this could be affecting anything—I’ve been completely fine though in terms of this otherwise and still take my other medicine. ","really long panic attack so im 18 and ive been under a crazy amount of stress lately im diagnosed with pretty severe anxiety and take a couple medications for it i have a history of panic attacks but ive never had anything like this and im starting to become really paranoid if maybe its not a panic attack and something wrong because its been a day now 

yesterday i was out of state with family and really stressed out but ultimately fine everything was good but i suddenly got a tight feeling in my upper chest around my neck and my face got kind of hot and tingly and my hands and tongue went numb i couldnt breathe and was taking deep breaths and got really scared because i couldnt breathe it went away for about ten minutes we got back in the car to drive home and it came back a lot worse i started freaking out because i thought i couldnt breathe and i was shaking like crazy and crying hyperventilating but eventually calmed down the whole hour car ride was like this where i would get it under control by reminding myself theres no reason i cant breathe and then it would randomly come back in waves with a pang of anxiety i felt a lot better after an hour and even went out with friends and was completely fine the rest of the night and this morning

Anxiety - dating app,"Posting this here as hoping it's just anxiety playing up! Can be difficult to see straight sometimes! Hoping someone who has used tinder can't help.

About 10 years ago I had a tinder account that I'm pretty sure I deleted, but having an anxious day and thought I needed to double check its gone.

I was prompted to create a new one when I went on the app (new phone) 'sign in with facebook' so did so, went through the steps and deleted the account, however my phone is a little dodgy and I didn't get the confirmation button after I pressed delete. I then started up the app and did the same i.e. 'sign in with facebook' again (I'm thinking surely if not deleted it would go straight to the same profile I just created?). And then created again and deleted, this time getting confirmation of deletion through the app. Before creating both those accounts I removed all photos obviously that had auto populated after linking to FB.

I obviously only ever had one Facebook, and so am worried I may still have the tinder Account!

birthday anxiety,"so for context: i’m 16(f) about to turn 17 and tomorrow is my birthday. i’ve been struggling with pretty severe anxiety and depression throughout this past year, and recently my therapist told me that she thinks i have OCD (but mostly internal like the pure O and it’s frequently related to morality) and we’re making plans to get me on some kind of ssri in the near future. 

back to the topic: i used to really enjoy my birthday, despite being pretty anxious whenever the day would come. for this birthday however, i want to do absolutely nothing. after weeks of debating and threatening to cancel i finally decided that since my friends and family would like to celebrate my birthday, i’ll agree to something simple like dinner and watching a movie at my house. that way we’ll be in public (so less attention on just me) and we’ll be watching a movie (again less attention on me). however when i went upstairs this morning to get breakfast after already struggling to get out of bed and take a shower and just get myself generally excited for today, i discovered that my mom completely decorated the living room where we’ll watch the movie with birthday decor and streamers and lights and so on. i wanted to keep it super lowkey, and having decorations is definitely NOT lowkey, so now i’m even more anxious and thinking about canceling the whole evening. i didn’t ask her to do that (although technically i never specified that i didn’t want decorations) and i don’t want to hurt her feelings. i’m grateful that she cares enough to celebrate me, believe me i’m so so grateful and lucky, but my anxiety and depression are just constantly convincing me that it’ll be embarrassing and that i’ll do or say something stupid with all of those bright shiny decorations. i really just wanted to do this to appease the people i care about and that’s it, so this just all feels like too much. it totally derailed my morning and now idk what to do. i can’t face her and ask her to help me take it down because i’ll just end up hurting her feelings and she won’t understand. honestly i just wish humans didn’t celebrate birthdays at all it would make things so much easier. so i guess i’m just asking for advice on how to handle this like a normal human being and just wondering if anyone else has experienced anxiety around their birthday ☹️",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lnnv9r/birthday_anxiety/,1751226814.0,anxiety,"birthday anxiety so for context: i’m 16(f) about to turn 17 and tomorrow is my birthday. i’ve been struggling with pretty severe anxiety and depression throughout this past year, and recently my therapist told me that she thinks i have OCD (but mostly internal like the pure O and it’s frequently related to morality) and we’re making plans to get me on some kind of ssri in the near future.

I sold my Glastonbury ticket and i hate myself,"
Last year I went to glasto for the first time. First ever festival At 27 years old. This year I was lucky enough to get another ticket.

I had a few issues with the group I was going with before I had to pay the full amount. I didn't feel they had been treating me particularly well, I felt I didn't want to ruin the memory of the year before. It was a lot of money. And the lineup wasn't massively to my taste. plus like 90% of the people who usually go weren’t going. So seemed like the right idea at the time

This week watching it happen has honestly been more painful that I could possibly imagine. It's triggered so much anxiety in me. It's made me realise how unhappy I've been. It's made me realise my friends have all drifted away from me. It's put my age in perspective. It's made me worry so so much.

I told them I had a work trip and I screwed up, hadn't booked the leave and couldn't get out of it. I didn't know what else to say. I didn't want to insult them but genuinely at the time I wasnt going ahead with it because I felt they'd ruin the memory for me. A completely stupid stupid thought and frankly I'm so angry at myself for that.

I'll be 30 next time it comes around. If I even get a ticket. Tickets are so hard to get. They are the one group that's ever wanted to try for tickets with me. What if they don't want me next time? What if they don't want to go next time? 2 years is a long time and I barely seen them anyway outside of Glastonbury anymore. My other friends have 0 interest.

I hate myself for this. Genuinely despise myself. And I can't let go of it. The number of years I've spent wishing I could do stuff like this, just to chuck it away. I'm worried how this is going to effect me going forward.",2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1lnicom/i_sold_my_glastonbury_ticket_and_i_hate_myself/,1751213227.0,anxiety,"I sold my Glastonbury ticket and i hate myself

Stopping my medication and doubting my diagnosis,"(Next week I have an appointment with my psychologist so I will tell her everything.)

Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my situation and maybe get some outside perspectives, because I honestly don’t know if I’m making the right choices.

I stopped taking venlafaxine (225 mg daily) completely, without consulting my psychiatrist. It was my own decision. The reason is that I recently started thinking I might have never actually been mentally ill in the first place.

One of the things that really pushed me to stop taking it was that I recently learned if someone with a healthy brain (no real mental disorder, no actual chemical imbalance) starts taking psychiatric meds, it could potentially mess up their brain chemistry and even make things worse. That freaked me out. It made me think: What if my brain was fine and now I’ve actually harmed it?

Back in 2023, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety. At that time, I did struggle with:

I constantly overthink. I replay things that happened in the past, especially moments when I felt embarrassed or like I messed up. I also worry a lot about the future - that I’ll fail, that I’ll disappoint people, that nothing will work out.

I’m very sensitive to what others think of me. I worry people don’t like me, or that they secretly laugh at me behind my back. Even going to a store or passing people on the street makes me nervous because I feel ugly or like everyone is judging me.

Social situations stress me out. I avoided them not because I was completely terrified, but because they made me anxious and uncomfortable. I’d sometimes shake or have racing thoughts. Still, I pushed myself to go when I had to. For example, to school, to university, to appointments - mostly because I didn’t want people to be mad at me or think badly of me.

I often feel this emptiness inside. Even when I’m doing something fun or feel happy, there’s still a sad, hollow feeling in the background, like life doesn’t really have a point.

I’ve also had suicidal thoughts for a long time. It wasn’t just wishing I didn’t exist. Many times I had actual thoughts about how I could do it, and serious moments where I really wanted to die. Sometimes plans would come into my head, not just vague ideas. It was more than just a passing thought. It felt like a real way out of everything or thinking I’d press a button to stop existing if that was possible.

All of this is tied to my low self-esteem and feeling stuck in a body and mind that I hate.

Sometimes I’m so mentally tired that I just want to lie in bed and do nothing. There were days like that, but I still got up when I had to.

I sometimes neglect things like washing my hair. I also don’t eat properly - I wait for someone else to make food, or just eat random stuff.

Even with all of this, I can still enjoy things. I do have interests and they make me happy, even if that sadness is always somewhere in the background.

People around me have told me that something seems wrong, based on the way I write or talk about things. They’ve said it’s clear I’m not completely okay.

A lot of this probably comes from feeling alone, worrying about the future, or not having a relationship - I’ve never been in one and feel like nobody would ever like me. It’s also tied to bigger, existential fears, like what’s the point of life at all.

Because of that, I started wondering if I unintentionally exaggerated my symptoms, and maybe that led the psychiatrist to misdiagnose me. In 2024, I didn’t see any mental health professionals at all. It wasn’t until January 2025 that I started therapy and saw a psychiatrist again, who prescribed me venlafaxine.

THE ESSENCE IS: these symptoms are not strong enough, I still do everything other healthy people do, and I function normally, I am NOT sad all the time and I am able to feel joy, there are moments where I do not feel anxiety and everything is okay.

 So I do not have any disorders and my conclusions: I SIMPLY HAVE LOW SELF-ESTEEM, EXISTENTIAL EMPTINESS AND SYMPTOMS SIMILAR TO MENTAL DISORDERS BUT I DO NOT MEET THE IMPORTANT SYMPTOMS.

Since then, the only real improvement was that my anxiety seemed slightly better. But the suicidal thoughts and general emptiness never went away. That’s part of why I just decided to quit taking it.

I guess I’m just looking for thoughts from people who’ve been in similar situations. How did you figure out if your diagnosis was accurate? Did you ever feel like you might have misrepresented your symptoms?

Can't stop worrying about my health,"Hello, i literally logged back into reddit to post this because i'm absolutely losing my mind.

Nervous that I may have lung cancer - or is it in my head? 😭,"Male, 37, non smoker (though I smoked thc often in my 20s.) It is now the end of June, but let’s rewind to January. I went to urgent care for coughing, heavy breathing, and weird sensations in my lung area (never had a fever/chills.) I was diagnosed with Pneumonia. Took antibiotics and a month later nothing had changed. Took another Xray and they said it looked “clear but also not” and they needed to send it off. It ultimately came back cleared. For the most part, the symptoms went away, but in May they came back. The doctor did a third X-ray, which showed that there is no pneumonia and nothing else to note. It’s now the end of June and I still have a slight cough, and when I exhale, I get a mild sharp pain in my upper chest on the right side. It doesn’t feel muscular and I can feel that it’s definitely associated with my breathing. Side note: I also have spinal pain (upper spine) for a year now and an MRI showed nothing. 

I know X-rays aren’t always accurate in detecting lung cancer, so I feel that I need a ct scan. Only issue is that doctors aren’t really taking me seriously because if I’m being honest, I have OCD and it causes me to become anxiously obsessed with whatever topic I’m on. I don’t want another X-ray so I don’t want to go to urgent care, and my doctor can’t see me for another month. The symptoms are definitely there and my anxiety isn’t creating them. Between doctors, being sick, and my anxiety, I’m going crazy 😣 I appreciate anyone who gives their advice. Thanks!

Anxiety of AI taking my job,"I have an irrational fear of losing my job or career forever to AI. I grew up poor and struggled to get my first corporate role. However, I've been in this field for 8 years now. Still, I'm extremely scared I'll lose my job or feel like I shouldn't have been in it at all. (I'm 35 and work in finance in a very high-paying position, but I only landed this job when I was 27). Before that, I was on a low-skilled track and didn't speak English.

So despite making a lot of money, I get to save less than 20% of it. If AI takes over, all of my family will be unemployed. It will be over. Just a few months ago one of my close friends who wen to an ivy league and worked a good job, was fired because of AI.

Doubts about starting on anxiety medication (lexapro),"Hi everyone. 

I'll try to make this as brief as possible. I am 20f and got prescribed medication (lexapro, starting with 5mg and then 10mg) for my persisting anxiety after being referred to a psichyatrist in the psychological clinic I attend to. 

I know I am a very anxious person, I have episodes once in a while where I spent like 3 days being misserable over a little thing, can't sleep, have muscle pain, can't concentrate, can't meet deadlines (even though I spend like 70% of my awake time worrying about them), but I will say it has definitely gotten better on the last two years. 

Before, I was so afraid to go to school. I used to run to the bathroom as often as possible to avoid talking to people. Whenever I had a free block I would start desesperately looking for a hiding spot to avoid being seen. I would get to college but could not get myself out of the car if I was specially worried that day. 

I don't do anything of the sort anymore. I am a teacher now, I have become a little bit better at functioning even though I still worry about a lot of things excessively. I now am on break from school so things have been great. 

Looking back I clearly needed help. It would have been awesome if it was delivered to me, but I am really worried I don't need it anymore and have spent hours looking for information on the side effects and possible outcomes for treating GAD. It sounds awesome to be anxiety free all the time, but should I give it a shot even knowing that I am mostly functional now? Or will that just fuck up my progress? 

I have been on therapy for 6 months. I definetely plan to keep going. I talked briefly about these concerns with both my psychiatrist and psychologist and they told me to give it a shot but I've been reeding a lot about how hard on the body it is to quit? 

I think the stigma about mental health has gotten to me and I'm not sure if I want to be medicated or if I need it. I am also worried about gaslighting (I don't know if I gaslighted my doctors into thinking I need medication or if I'm gaslighting me into thinking I don't) HELP 

It would be great if you shared your experiences with medication with me, and your opinion of this whole shebang. Anything would be appreciated, thank you very much for reading. Have a great day

It would be great if you shared your experiences with medication with me, and your opinion of this whole shebang. Anything would be appreciated, thank you very much for reading. Have a great day 

","doubts about starting on anxiety medication lexapro hi everyone 

ill try to make this as brief as possible i am 20f and got prescribed medication lexapro starting with 5mg and then 10mg for my persisting anxiety after being referred to a psichyatrist in the psychological clinic i attend to 

i know i am a very anxious person i have episodes once in a while where i spent like 3 days being misserable over a little thing cant sleep have muscle pain cant concentrate cant meet deadlines even though i spend like 70 of my awake time worrying about them but i will say it has definitely gotten better on the last two years 

before i was so afraid to go to school i used to run to the bathroom as often as possible to avoid talking to people whenever i had a free block i would start desesperately looking for a hiding spot to avoid being seen i would get to college but could not get myself out of the car if i was specially worried that day 

i dont do anything of the sort anymore i am a teacher now i have become a little bit better at functioning even though i still worry about a lot of things excessively i now am on break from school so things have been great 

looking back i clearly needed help it would have been awesome if it was delivered to me but i am really worried i dont need it anymore and have spent hours looking for information on the side effects and possible outcomes for treating gad it sounds awesome to be anxiety free all the time but should i give it a shot even knowing that i am mostly functional now or will that just fuck up my progress 

i have been on therapy for 6 months i definetely plan to keep going i talked briefly about these concerns with both my psychiatrist and psychologist and they told me to give it a shot but ive been reeding a lot about how hard on the body it is to quit 

i think the stigma about mental health has gotten to me and im not sure if i want to be medicated or if i need it i am also worried about gaslighting i dont know if i gaslighted my doctors into thinking i need medication or if im gaslighting me into thinking i dont help

How to stop anxiety FOREVER,"Hey so I’m pretty new to this, I had a total of 3 anxiety attacks months apart from each other. But since the first happened I always have a fear it might happen again.

romantic affection of any kind makes my anxiety sky rocket.,"So before I go into details, yes I have been going to therapy for more than a year now and have been trying to improve myself in multiple ways when it comes to taking care of my anxiety. 

But one thing that is still a persistent issue that I have been struggling with is, any kind of affection in a romantic sense, really makes me unbelievably anxious. Like feeling ill type of anxiety. I have tried to describe this to friends and my therapist and most don't really get it. But for me it basically goes like this. 

When it comes to my platonic or familial relationships, I really don't have any issue with either verbal or physical affection, I say I love you to both close friends and family, I always give hugs to both too. No issue at all. But I wouldn't really ever do those things to a stranger or person I barely know. Because for me, saying or doing any of those things is me expressing how I feel about them. 

But when it comes to any kind of affection in a romantic scenario it just gives me this debilitating anxiety. For me a lot of the time whenever I have been on dates or in my past attempts at relationships, it ended up with this weird confusion where I am always questioning why they are flirting with me or why they are touching me, etc. I will say my last relationship was a wreck because the girl I was with was love bombing me a lot and things got sexual really quickly but whenever I asked ""what are we"" it was always vague non-answers. So I just ended up feeling as though I was just used for gratification. 

Honestly not sure how to ""fix"" or get over this anxiety because I want to not feel this way but its one of the worst manifestations of my anxiety.

New to anxiety,"I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder three weeks ago. ( that’s two months after my older sister was diagnosed with bipolar disease) Since then, I’ve been taking Escitalopram 10 mg once a day, and Clonazepam—1 tablet daily for the first week, then only when needed.
The first week and a half went well in terms of reducing panic attacks and improving sleep. I only experienced some morning nausea, acid reflux, loss of appetite and occasional vomiting which have now become less frequent.
However, over the past week and a half, things have changed. The panic attacks have returned, becoming more frequent and lasting longer. I’ve also been experiencing increased fear, numbness in the skin of my arms and legs, and back pain. Despite that, the symptoms were still tolerable, and taking half a tablet of Clonazepam helped me sleep.
Now, over the last two days, I’ve been feeling constantly anxious and fearful, with an increased heart rate and a stronger urge to smoke. During the first week, I barely thought about smoking and only had around four cigarettes a day, but in the past two days, it’s been over ten. I’ve also been spending a lot of time online researching various mental illnesses—ranging from depression to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.
