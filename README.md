# 🧠 MindGuard – Mental Health Sentiment Analyzer (Reddit NLP Dashboard)

MindGuard is an end-to-end, real-time NLP dashboard that monitors Reddit posts related to mental health. It uses both **TextBlob** and **BERT (Transformer)** models to detect signs of anxiety, depression, and emotional distress. Built with **Streamlit**, the dashboard offers sentiment comparison, filters, and rich visual analytics.
